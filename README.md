# What is this?

This is all the content for https://jakelee.co.uk, a Jekyll site using [minimaJake](https://github.com/JakeSteam/minimaJake)!

# How does it work?

All my sites use the same shared Jekyll theme, as explained here: https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/merging-multiple-jekyll-codebases-into-one/
