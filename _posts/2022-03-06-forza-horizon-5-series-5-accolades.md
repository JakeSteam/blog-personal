With Forza Horizon 5's fifth series, Horizon Rush Takeover, a ton of new PR stunts & a stunt arena were added alongside the usual cars. Additionally, 23 new accolades were added, here's how to get them all!

## Speed Zone Completion Accolades

These are the simplest to get, and self explanatory:

### Airfield Speed Zone

| Name | Description | Points | 
| -- | -- | -- |
| Airfield Speed Zone Novice | Earn 1 star from the Airfield Speed Zone | 100 |
| Airfield Speed Zone Expert | Earn 2 stars from the Airfield Speed Zone | 250 |
| Airfield Speed Zone Master | Earn 3 stars from the Airfield Speed Zone | 500 |

A pretty easy speed zone, it can be done with your preferred street racing car e.g. Sesto Elemento. Approaching from the west and just driving the zone will get you over the required 150MPH easily.

### Desierto Viviente Speed Zone

| Name | Description | Points | 
| -- | -- | -- |
| Desierto Viviente Novice | Earn 1 star from the Desierto Viviente Speed Zone | 100 |
| Desierto Viviente Expert | Earn 2 stars from the Desierto Viviente Speed Zone | 250 |
| Desierto Viviente Master | Earn 3 stars from the Desierto Viviente Speed Zone | 500 |

This speed zone is a little trickier, and requires a good offroad car. Approaching from the north west lets you cut a few corners quite aggressively, and once you know the route shouldn't take long. A few car options, S1 should be enough to get the required 90MPH:
* 1986 Hoonigan Ford RS200 Evolution 
* 1985 Porsche #185 959 Prodrive Rally Raid
* 1999 Ford Racing Puma Forza Edition (I used this!)

### Trébol Speed Zone

| Name | Description | Points | 
| -- | -- | -- |
| Trébol Novice | Earn 1 star from the Trébol Speed Zone | 100 |
| Trébol Expert | Earn 2 stars from the Trébol Speed Zone | 250 |
| Trébol Master | Earn 3 stars from the Trébol Speed Zone | 500 |

This is down the high speed highway in the middle of the map, and is a great opportunity to bring out the max speed cars like the Jesko!  Approaching this from the west and getting a big run up will let you hit 300MPH+ (well over the required 260MPH).

It's worth mentioning I had a weird lag spike every time I entered the speed zone, making the slight left over a hill a little challenging.

### Camino del Cielo Speed Zone

| Name | Description | Points | 
| -- | -- | -- |
| Camino del Cielo Novice | Earn 1 star from the Camino del Cielo Speed Zone | 100 |
| Camino del Cielo Expert | Earn 2 stars from the Camino del Cielo Speed Zone | 250 |
| Camino del Cielo Master | Earn 3 stars from the Camino del Cielo Speed Zone | 500 |

Whilst this speed zone is pretty easy in the reliable Sesto Elemento or any other S2 car from either direction, the mixture of straights and corners makes it a tricky one to pick a perfect car for. Everything I tried seemed to get around 141!

## Overall PR Stunt Completion Accolades

These accolades just require 3 starring the new PR stunts:

| Name | Description | Points | 
| -- | -- | -- |
| Speed All Night Long | Earn 3 stars on all new Speed Traps | 250 |
| Party Blazer | Earn 3 stars on all new Trailblazers | 250 |
| Live The Danger | Earn 3 stars on all new Danger Signs | 250 | 

## Stunt Park Accolades

| Name | Description | Points | Tips |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Right up my alley | Smash 50 bowling pins at the Stunt Park | 100 | No tips needed! |
| Force of distraction | Earn 3 Crash Landing Skills within 1 minute at the Stunt Park | 100 | For this you need to land then immediately knock something over. The easiest place to do this is the orange square jump with a line of bowling pins. [Video](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForzaHorizon/comments/t5xvj0/force_of_distraction_accolade_quick/). |
| Spin master | Earn 3 Barrel Roll Skills at the Stunt Park | 100 | The easiest way to get these is to drive half your car up a ramp, then land on your wheels after a roll in the air. I found the sides of the "half pipe" in the middle to be good for this. |
| Stuntman | Start at the west Stadium entrance and perform 2 loops at the Stunt Park in the Yellow Zone in under 20 seconds | 100 | This requires completing the loop-the-loop, and approaching from the left or right should give you enough time. You can rewind after completing the first loop to cheat if you're struggling! |
| Get the drift | Earn 2 Awesome Drift or Awesome E-Drift Skills within 15 seconds at the Stunt Park | 100 | No tips needed! |
| Floor is lava | Drive from the west Stadium entrance to the Green Zone of the Stunt Park in under 45 seconds while performing 3 Ultimate Air Skills | 100 | I had trouble unlocking this one, it only seemed to work when I got the air skills outside the green area, then came back in afterwards. |

## Other Accolades

**Horizon Style** worth 250 points and rewarding a Horizon Rush t-shirt just requires completing the new parade race. This can be done on any difficulty, but it's a pretty easy race! Feel free to drift the ridiculous parade float around corners, and barge the AI out of the way.

**Series 5 Collector** worth 1000 points isn't obtainable at time of writing, but you'll get it automatically by the end of the season if you're completing half of the tasks! Here are the required cars:
* 1965 MINI Cooper S Forza Edition (80 pts overall in series 5)
