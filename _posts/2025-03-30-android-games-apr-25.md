This batch of Android game recommendations has two idle games and a platformer! None are very long, all are worth playing.

## #1: [Ore Buster](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tornupgaming.orebuster)

I spotted this short but sweet incremental in the ever-reliable [r/incremental_games "What games are you playing" thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/incremental_games/comments/1j7r4qf/what_games_are_you_playing_this_week_game/mh2hv0j/). It only took a couple of hours to complete, so it's worth your time!

Whilst it is simple, the powerful unlocks are delivered rapidly, and avoid the gameplay ever becoming stale. Tap the rocks, upgrade your stuff. Repeat.

### Screenshots

All screenshots are from version 1.0.5:

### Review

One of the simplest concepts I've seen in an incremental, your little guy mines rocks, you swipe / tap to collect the ores mined. Eventually he runs out of stamina, and you use the ores to buy upgrades and play again. That's the entire thing!

Later on in the game you'll unlock a chance to spawn gold rocks, plus a "mythical" rock that unlocks the next difficulty. Unfortunately each of these difficulties is visually identical, with the only changes being higher stamina drain and rock strength, but higher ore value. This means there's no reason to ever play a difficulty beyond the highest you can survive at.

Collecting the ores is much easier than I initially suspected, with a vague swiping over the screen collecting a large area. You have no control over your character whatsoever, so calmly collecting dropped ores is as active as it gets!

So if the game is just the same grassy field over and over, what's the appeal? The upgrades! They're all pretty affordable, with a few upgrades being purchasable after every short run. These vary from fairly boring move speed or pickaxe strength up to stamina regeneration, rock igniting, lightning, automatic resource collecting, etc, and make each run feel a little bit different.

This rapid progress is great for making an enjoyable game, but unfortunately means you'll reach the end pretty quickly and unceremoniously! It's a real shame that the steady pace of new content and improvement wasn't sustained into some sort of new areas, or additional complexity, since there's no replay value in a linear upgrade tree. For example, you'll quickly unlock gold and then... no other ore ever.

### Monetisation

There's incentivised adverts, each of which give a pretty generous 20 minutes of double ore. There are also cheap in-app purchases (Â£1.19 / ~$1.50) for double strength or stamina, a speed boost, etc. I purchased a speed boost.

### Tips

- Stamina is what ends your run, so upgrades like stamina regeneration or stamina on rock destroy are extremely important.
- If your runs are ending within a few seconds, lower the difficulty and you'll earn far more.
- Destroying mythical rocks only happens a few times, so shouldn't be prioritised for upgrades.

## #2: [Idle Space Force](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.FuseGamesLLC.IdleSpaceForce)

Another r/incremental_games find, posted [by the developer](https://www.reddit.com/r/incremental_games/comments/1j88ky1/idle_space_force_new_level_upgrades_dinosaur_pet/)! Idle Space Force is a fairly simple but satisfying incremental across multiple planets.

### Screenshots

All screenshots are from version 12.2.2:

### Review

This is one of those games where you'll "get" it within 5 minutes, and will know whether you enjoy the gameplay loop or not!

You'll spend your time gathering fuel in space, then travelling to various planets and collecting other exclusive resources to purchase upgrades (and eventually upgrade fuel capacity to get to the next planet). This is done by shooting enemies on a vertically scrolling screen, with persistent upgrades unlocking idle money, passive attacks, etc.

As with many incremental games, it's impossible to "fail" at any point. Instead, you just need to wait for your fuel (or other collectible) quantity to hit the necessary amount, then you'll be able to progress. It is very linear, with almost no strategy, beyond identifying if any upgrades are close to the 25/50/75/100 milestones that unlock a 2x purchase.

Progress is fairly quick initially, but slows down around the planet "Petra". Unfortunately there's little active gameplay here, with the only viable approach leaving the game open for a couple of days to collect enough "fossils".

Active gameplay is possible, but after a few weapon upgrades slowly swiping left to right will provide almost identical results to anything more challenging, and is only slightly better than letting your passive weapons work. There is a "wormhole" feature that provides bonuses, but again it's not much better than passive income (or swiping without looking).

There are a few extra bits that are worth calling out. You'll have daily quests (just defeat X, play for X seconds, kill X extra large monsters) providing star coins or temporary boosts, and a standard daily item bonus. This is likely where my first pet will come from, with "Panda" unlocked after Day 15. There's also a "boost" feature which provides a slight increase in enemy rate for a very brief period.

Overall there's a satisfying gameplay loop, but the gameplay can feel a little thin after a couple of planets. Honestly I was pretty bored with the game around Planet 4, however the prestige mechanic on the final planet added some depth. I'm a little concerned that the prestiged playthrough is... almost identical to the first playthrough. I'll probably complete another playthrough or two, since the prestige bonuses look interesting.

Definitely worth a look, to at least check if the core gameplay loop is something you enjoy.

Update: Despite my lukewarm review, I'm still playing! I've done 4-5 playthroughs now, and whilst the gameplay hasn't changed or evolved, I should mention that as you prestige you'll unlock new planets. So far I've unlocked two boss fights with pets as rewards, and I'm probably going to keep playing.

### Monetisation

There are a few monetisation methods, luckily all of them are optional (and none feel too overpowered).

Primarily there's the ability to watch an advert for instant cash (or 2x boost), but this is typically a fairly small amount and not worth doing. Additionally, there's the usual ad-free purchase (a bit too expensive for me, at Â£6.49 (~$8.50)), and a premium "star coins" currency used for permanent boosts.

These star coins can be earned slowly through normal gameplay (this is good!), and used to permanently double item drops or boost cash gain, unlock pets, access cosmetics, temporarily boost loot, etc. Interestingly, there's even a [Patreon link](https://www.patreon.com/IdleSpaceForce), with $5/mo unlocking unique cosmetics.

Whilst I do appreciate how the monetisation is entirely optional, I'm not a fan of the loot chests that can be purchased, and the premium currency is fairly expensive. For context, I'm a few days in and have around 90 star coins (100 is Â£2 (~$3)), so will shortly be able to buy a chest (5-20% chance at a pet), a purely cosmetic theme, or a temporary boost.

A few days later, I've earned around 500. I've spent 200 on chests (a waste!), and am now saving them for pet bundles.

### Tips

- Generators have 2x purchases unlocked at 25/50/75/100, so it's worth getting to those milestones if possible.
- Each new generator is usually far more valuable than the one before, make sure to focus them.
- Progress is pretty linear, so not many tips are needed!
- When the horde mode power-up is activated, it's worth the extra effort to play actively, engaging boost etc.

## #3: [Lucky Luna](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.NGP.LuckyLuna&hl=en_GB)

Another free Netflix game, Lucky Luna feels distinctly different from most games I review. It's clearly a premium, polished platformer, and I'm surprised it hasn't received more attention along with Monument Valley etc.

### Screenshots

There's an official trailer! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jhfofq-ehw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jhfofq-ehw)

All screenshots are from version 1.0.34:

### Review

It's unusual a game is controlled almost entirely through swiping left and right, no jumping, and this is especially true for a platformer!

The clearly well-designed levels instead guide you through them, with horizontal and downwards motion being the main ways of navigating. Each level is, sonic-style, a linear but branching route, with plenty of hidden extras behind secret walls or tricky jumps. Somewhat startlingly, according to Wikipedia Lucky Luna was [in development for 8 years(!)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucky_Luna#Development), making my primary criticism even stranger: there's only 6 levels in this platformer.

Each of these levels are dense, and have bonus areas, challenges, and reward multiple playthroughs, but there's still only 6. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that you can't _really_ fail. You can fail a bonus are, and immediately try again, but in the main levels you'll just respawn a little way back to have another go. This does combine well with the one-hit-kill mechanics, however it unfortunately makes some areas essentially trial and error to complete.

Finishing a level gives you a score across 3 metrics (pearls earned, deaths, time), with a medal awarded for each. Assuming you've explored each level at a medium pace, it's pretty normal to receive none / bronze medal for all 3! This is especially true with deaths, where you're going to die a lot just figuring out how things work. I can see how replaying a level for fast completion may be of interest to speedrunners, but for me completed is completed.

The game features essentially no text, instead relying on the control scheme being intuitive enough. This is mostly true, however the lack of information gives the game a slightly surreal feel, where I have no idea who I am, where I am, or why I'm doing anything. The [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucky_Luna) adds story information that would have been helpful to know!

> The game's setting was inspired by The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter, a tale from Japanese folklore about a princess from the Moon who grows up on Earth, who sets her six suitors impossible tasks before ascending to her throne on the Moon.

Overall the game is satisfying to play, but the one-hit-kills combined with meandering gameplay make it hard to love. I've struggled to pick it up for more than a few minutes, with the abysmal end of level scores not being a great motivator! If I knew there was some sort of point to the progression it might be more engaging.

There's a highly praised endless mode that I haven't tried, having only completed 4 of the 6 levels despite having it installed for weeks (mostly due to hesitance to play, not difficulty!).

### Monetisation

Netflix game, so entirely free if you have a subscription.

### Tips

- Make sure you trigger every checkpoint you pass, so you can respawn on them.
- Bonus areas are hidden pretty well, try nudging any suspicious looking walls.
- You can adjust the swipe speed in settings if it feels "off".
