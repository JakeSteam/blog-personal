This month is actually "1 game I'm obsessed with, and 2 that are OK"! Still, I've enjoyed all 3 to some degree, maybe you will too.

## #1: [IdleTale](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.EdGrace.Idle)

IdleTale is an autofighter incremental, with perhaps the best drip-feeding of content I've ever seen in a game.

### Review

At least 5-6 times so far during my time with IdleTale, I've been sure I'm _about_ to reach the end of the early access content. And yet, every time, a new mechanic, area, upgrade, or complexity appears _just in time_ to keep me hooked!

As a heads-up, this game is [also available (for free) on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3196540/IdleTale/), with a more detailed description than the Play Store. This review will also have spoilers of my experience so far.

The core gameplay is extremely simple. Automatically run right, tap to attack enemy (later upgrades automate this, or let you just hold down instead of tap). Enemies drop gold (and XP later), that can be used to upgrade your skills, buy upgrades, upgrade enemies, etc. However, this simple basic game quickly evolves...

My screenshots later on in this post will probably seem unrelated to the game you initially download. Those 6 buttons at the bottom? All appear through progress. The dungeon & map selector on the right? Appears through progress. Glory, energy, 2x coin boost, selecting character? Through progress! In fact, ignoring the 4 simple "Skills" upgrades (e.g. Wisdom, which boosts crit damage & attack power), there are 6 upgrade paths I've found _so far_:

1. Level-up upgrades: Two skill trees, drastic upgrades with multiple levels and unique features. Can pay a small fee to respec at any time.
2. Shop upgrades: More linear, used to unlock new areas, stat boosts, etc.
3. "Gains" upgrades: Typical basic incremental upgrades, just used for increasing passive income (although purchasing these can unlock shop upgrades).
4. Codex upgrades: Expensive, but boosts the XP & GP dropped by enemies in an area.
5. Glory upgrades: Prestige upgrades, very hard to earn points but unlock significant new content (e.g. character switcher) much later in the game.
6. Gear upgrades: Typically earned from grinding boss dungeons, there's no way to upgrade gear but hunting high level equipment is very rewarding.

I've no doubt whatsoever that there's far more to unlock even after my 10-15 hours, e.g. on my next prestige I'm going to buy "Bad Luck Aura", which unlocks "Bad Luck Shop and the Lucky Coins". What does this do? No idea, but it makes me want to unlock it to find out!

There's excellent artwork throughout, with at least 10 challenge dungeons (with unique bosses and settings) and 10 maps (automatic fighting), all featuring fully animated enemies. This is lucky, since you'll be grinding maps quite a lot, so appealing visuals help.

The game does a good job of balancing various currencies and traits, since you'll need to choose level-up perks and equipment based on your playstyle, whilst also considering dodge chance, attack speed, crit chance, multi-hit chance, glory gains, elemental resistance, haunted weapon spawning, and more.

Whilst this might make the game seem chaotic and confusing, the slow release of features ensures you're never overwhelmed, and instead constantly have a couple of goals to work towards.

Extremely engrossing and absorbing, I'm terrified I'll never escape playing this game!

### Monetisation

There's none. At all. Anywhere. I have absolutely no idea how this has been made free so far, with the Steam page showcasing the staggering amount of free content available:

> **What is the current state of the Early Access version?**
>
> "As of now, IdleTale offers over several weeks of content, featuring over 400 items to collect, over 250 achievements to unlock, 50 total levels, over 30 different dungeons (counting Normal and Deadly modes) and a lot of enemies and maps to discover!"
>
> **Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?**
>
> "IdleTale will remain free after launch."

I presume in-app purchases will appear eventually, but there's nothing yet.

### Tips

- Shop upgrades are often unlocked after purchasing X (e.g. 10, 25, 50, 100) of the simple idle cash generators (e.g. health potions), so try to purchase in batches.
- I tried to balance my idle income and active income, e.g. ensuring my "Gains" were upgraded as much as my "Skills" / "Codex". Of course shop upgrades affect this, but it's something to aim for!
- You can likely do dungeons earlier than you think, when you're at or just before the minimum level. However, there's no point doing them until you can use the reward weapons (tap them on dungeon preview for minimum level).
- When prestiging, be clear what glory upgrade you're aiming for. Once you're earning glory it's pretty easy to gain a few more, so push further if you can wait. If I didn't have a specific perk I was aiming for, I'd aim for 2x my current glory points.
- Respeccing your level up perks is quite cheap, so if you've hit a wall it's worth trying. In the mid-game I found the "assassination" path to be better for damage & boss fights, but later on found specialising in crit chance & damage useful.
- I did my first prestige around level 33, and my second around 35, with subsequent prestiges every 2-3 levels. This felt late enough, and may have even been a bit early, since rebuilding after a prestige takes significant effort.
- Whilst you can store & withdraw items from the armoury across playthroughs based on your level, you'll likely only be doing this manually for a single run so it's not worth worrying about much. There's an "autogear" button unlocked via prestige later.
- There's [a discord server](https://discord.com/invite/B9mamWkNtV) with a startling 3700 members, I haven't joined yet though as I'm enjoying the discovery process. I'll likely give it a look once I've hit a "wall" I can't find a way past.
- You're _really_ going to want to have some way to auto-tap / hold down on the screen if you don't want to have your thumbs held down all day! If you play lots of incremental games you may have one already (I use the now delisted "QuickTouch").

## #2: [Alto's Odyssey](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noodlecake.altosodyssey)

A non-incremental game with a single button control scheme? Yep, Alto's Odyssey is a super simple exploration game, and whilst it's not going to hold your attention for long, it's fun for a bit.

### Review

Whilst this isn't the first game of this style I've played, it's probably the simplest and prettiest. You're Alto, sandboarding forever and ever across the dunes, tapping the screen to jump and holding to rotate. That's it!

There's a little nuance added through things like tornadoes (lifting you up in the air), hot air balloons with connecting lines (extra coins), and performing backflips for extra speed & impact protection, but the core behaviour never changes. There's also changing weather, and a day/night cycle.

Progression through the game consists of 2 things, levels and coins. Coins are used in the "workshop", essentially a store where you can buy items like a "Mysterious Radio" or a "Wingsuit", or pay real money for perks like double coins or ad removal. Levels are a set of 3 objectives you need to complete, e.g. "Rip 50 balloon flags in one run".

Overall it's an extremely simple game, and I was amazed to discover it's actually a sequel to the identical looking [Alto's Adventure](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noodlecake.altosadventure). I assume there's some differences but... good luck identifying them from the screenshots!

Whilst Alto's Odyssey is pretty, especially with the day-night cycle, the minimalist design is also a drawback. After 20-30 runs, I'm really not sure there's much interest left. Sure, there's new characters to unlock, and new features, but they're not going to change the extremely repetitive core gameplay, nor the aggressive monetisation.

Years ago I spent a lot of time with [Extreme Road Trip 2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.roofdog.roadtrip2), which is vastly more complex, with a far higher skill ceiling, more dynamic gameplay, many more game mechanics, and just overall a far, far more interesting experience. Even "[Tiny Wings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6pT_2E5xI0)" from 2011 is a more engrossing game, despite running on phones 13 years ago!

### Monetisation

It's pretty bad, unfortunately.

There's forced 30-second adverts after every run, in-app purchases to remove adverts, double coins, buy coins for item purchases etc, and incentivised adverts.

I strongly suspect the coin earning rate is made far more "grindy" than it needs to be purely to encourage spending real money. However, I personally wasn't enjoying the game enough to pay for ad removal, but at least it's priced reasonably (£2 / $3).

### Tips

It's a simple game, so tips are limited.

- Always play it safe, there's not that much benefit to doing an extra flip instead of just landing it safely.
- However, if you're not doing _any_ tricks at all you'll likely be going too slowly to make any of the jumps.
- Since there's an advert between each run making repeated runs painful, make sure you're focusing on your objectives not just mindlessly coin farming.

## #3: [Cat Magic School](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tree.idle.cat.academy)

TREEPLLA have made a niche for themselves with cute, cat-based incremental games... but this Harry Potter inspired variant is not one of their best. I debated even including it in this article, but there is _some_ enjoyment to be had!

### Review

With the similar (but far better) [Cat Town Valley](/android-games-september-2024/#2-cat-town-valley) releasing a month or two ago, and the even better [Office Cat](/android-games-late-april-2024/#1-office-cat) earlier in the year, the aggressive release schedule is perhaps to blame for some of the game's issues.

The gameplay is similar to Office Cat overall (upgrade offices to earn revenue, and repeat), but with the variation of upgrading magical classrooms to train wizards. You earn revenue for cats signing up, taking classes, eating food, passing exams, etc.

Visuals are somewhat magical, again very similar (yet inferior) to Office Cat, plus a few magical broomsticks scattered around. Whilst it is (mostly) high quality, it's less Hogwarts, more Hogwarts decorations in an office.

The classrooms themselves are responsible for a truly baffling design choice. The number of cats that visit your school is affected by your class success rate. Since each classroom's level, capacity, and speed can be upgraded, surely these will improve success rate? Nope, higher level classrooms actually _fail more often_!

Luckily the game has info on how to improve class success rates, there's only 2 ways:

1. Use many "Gems" (premium currency, some rewarded occasionally) to pay for a small increase in rate. Every gem I've earned in the game so far just about lets me get a 10% pass rate increase.
2. Use the correct professor's "cards" (very rare) and magic potions (semi-rare currency) to upgrade the professor, again for a minor bump. Or, of course, pay lots of gems to upgrade.

Using one of my classrooms as an example, only 35% of students are passing, yet there is no way to improve this number without paying significantly for gems. Now, repeat this for every classroom. Great. Similarly, improving the bigger, "student upgrade" exam is done by professor upgrades or improving classrooms.

The cumulative effect of this is that you'll quickly end up with a school where most students are failing most classes, your revenue is slow due to this, and there's seemingly no (free) way to make significant progress.

Shallow engagement events (click this to get some money, click this to get some gems, click this to get some wizard's stones, click this student to wake them up) are scattered around your school's grounds, but you'll see all of them in your first 5 minutes and there is no variation or complexity. The only game with any complexity is "Lucky Crystal Ball", where you blindly pick rewards from 4 options a few times in a row, until eventually "Unlucky Balls" that cause a complete loss begin to appear. You can stop at any time and earn half your rewards, but there's no skill involved, just luck.

Progression is also pretty limited, with my school looking pretty similar 1 day vs 7 days in. Sure, a few new plain looking rooms, but the overall changes are very limited. This is really disappointing, since the magic theme gives free rein for almost anything, yet we've ended up with empty offices!

Overall it's a worse variation of their past games, with an obnoxious focus on aggressive monetisation. Instead of "enjoy for free, pay / watch adverts to progress faster", this is more "slow progress until you are forced to constantly watch adverts / pay for any progress". Awful.

### Monetisation

Playing Cat Magic School is a battle against accidental advert watching. Whilst there technically aren't any forced adverts, almost every screen will have a button that will trigger an advert, often with an "!" indicating something that requires attention. Looking at the main game screen, I can see 8 buttons that would open an advert, a shop, or a prompt to spend the premium currency gems.

It's overwhelming, and tiring.

There's all the typical expensive ad removal package (£17, approx $22), offline package, multiple starter packages, 5 gem purchases (up to £70, approx $90), 3 wizard's stone purchases, 3 magic potion purchases, plus all the nudges to spend gems that will open the shop if you don't have enough.

Finally, the linear quest system will sometimes literally require watching a few adverts, removing any illusions that the adverts are optional!

### Tips

- The quest system tells you exactly what to do, there's no need to try and plan ahead.
- Resources are hard to come by, so make sure to claim them as they appear.
