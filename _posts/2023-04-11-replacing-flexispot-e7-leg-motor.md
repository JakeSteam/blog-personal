I purchased a Flexispot E7 recently, and had a great experience with it. I then purchased an additional one for my partner and encountered an issue. After contacting support, replacement motors were sent, but with no instructions! Here's how to replace them.

Note that there is [a semi-official guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/FlexiSpot_Official/comments/zpf07i/motor_replacement_tutorial/) posted by a support rep, but the images are tiny and extremely low quality.

## Step 1: Preparing the leg

First, flip your desk upside down, and unplug the leg you're going to be working on (M1 / M2).

## Step 2: Unscrewing the leg

Unscrew the 4 connecting screws, using either the Flexispot tool or your own screwdriver.

## Step 3: Flipping the leg

Flip the leg again, it will need supporting whilst you work on it.

## Step 4: Removing the case

Unscrew the 4 long screws holding the black case in place, again using the Flexispot tool or your own.

Next, slide off the black case. Note that the case will be wedged into a rubber part on the cable, make sure to remove it from this.

## Step 5: Replacing the motor

Unscrew the 2 long screws using the Flexispot tool again, and the central nut holding the motor on.

Slide the motor off vertically, and put the new one in. Then replace all of the screws, making sure the central nut is the correct way up (rounded bit facing away from the motor).

## Step 6: Reinstalling the leg

Simply repeat steps 1-4 in reverse! When screwing the leg back in, I recommend doing the diagonal screws first, to avoid alignment issues.

Your Flexispot desk now has a new motor, hopefully it fixes any issues!
