As anyone who has seen my [Goodreads](/analysing-my-goodreads-book-history/) or [Kindle](/analysing-5-years-of-amazon-kindle-reading/) analysis posts knows, I read a *lot*. Once I had a bit of space at home, I started collecting books I'd read in the past, and reading physical books more. Here's a summary of my collection in 2022, along with a little bit of analysis!

Later this year I'll write about *why* and *how* I collect, this post is just the baseline *what* has been collected.

Without any further ado, here's my poor overloaded living room bookcases:

I've added some basic colour coding to (attempt to) prove it isn't just a chaotic mess:

* Red: Hardback fiction (except bottom-right square, "unread books")
* Yellow: Hardback non-fiction (except bottom-left square, "comics")
* Blue: Paperback fiction (except top-left square on the right, "novelty")
* Green: Paperback non-fiction

    </tr>
</table>

There are an additional 31 books in the "unread" square, giving a total of **596 owned books** (403 fiction + 162 non-fiction + 31 unread)!

My Goodreads "owned" shelf only has 569 books, so 27 books aren't accurately recorded, oops! I suspect almost all of these are books without a Goodreads page (e.g. local guidebooks, books from friends), or a difference in listing (e.g. a set listed as 1 book, but I counted the physical books individually), although undoubtedly there's a few mistakes.

## Analysis

### Book format

With hardcover books generally costing ~2-3x as much as paperback, the vast majority of my books are paperback. However, it is interesting that this split only applies to fiction, I assume this is because I tend to only buy hardcover books I really like, and liking a mixture of fiction and non-fiction is expected.

The third category might require a bit of explanation... This includes things like Tintin, webcomics, trivia books, and other books that despite being paperback or hardcover, aren't traditional books.

### Book content

Since I read fiction exclusively for years on my Kindle (and then purchased physical copies), it's unsurprising that I've got ~2.5x as many fiction books. Most of these are science fiction from before I spread out my interests a bit (I ran out of golden age scifi!), and I suspect my recent reading is fairly evenly split.

### Book source

This is probably the factor that distinguishes my collection from most! Almost all of my books are second hand, and from charity shops. I'll eventually write a proper post about how I collect books, but needless to say paying £1-2 per book has made this collection far more affordable.

For hardcover or paperback books, around 80-90% of books are preowned. The new ones are generally gifts from others, for example 13 of my 18 new paperback fiction books are gifted Isaac Asimov [Foundation](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/isaac-asimov-foundation-books-collection/dp/9123654082) & [Robots](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/Isaac-Asimov-Collection-Robots-Empire/dp/9124369896) series. This also explains why comic / novelty books are almost entirely new, as these are usually gifts from friends or family.

## Storage progression

1. When I first moved in, I had 1 small black bookcase, and plenty of space in it.
2. This slowly filled up, and I replaced it with a larger white bookcase.
4. Aug '19: This then filled up, and I purchased a tall DVD tower bookcase that just about fit in a gap, and was flexible enough to also display LEGO etc.
3. Sep '19: These filled up, and I purchased a "Large 6-compartment" bookcase to put on top.
5. Nov '19: This too filled up, and I replicated the entire setup to buy a couple of years future storage!
6. Apr '22: I finally resorted to "vertically stacking" 2 layers of the SF Masterworks in the bottom left, and the paperback non-fiction in the bottom right.

As is immediately obvious, I've now entirely run out of space! Finding space for all of the books has been a challenge in careful measurement and creative thinking, I wish I'd taken photos after each change to show the progression.

The current storage setup is:
* 2x "[Argos Home Maine 5 Shelf Tall & Wide Deep Bookcase](https://www.argos.co.uk/product/6092139)": I paid £48 each, they are now £60. 
* 2x "[VASAGLE Wooden 3-Tier Bookcase](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B074FVGZPJ/)": I paid £45 each, they are now £66.
* 2x "[Argos Home Maine Tall CD and DVD Media Storage Tower](https://www.argos.co.uk/product/9328673)": I paid £27 each, they are now £48.
* Total: £240 (including delivery), would be £348(!) today.

And for those interested, non-books also included in the photo are:

* [Stephen King artwork by Jordan Monsell](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/608090945/king-country-stephen-king-wall-art)
* [LEGO NASA Space Shuttle Discovery](https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/nasa-space-shuttle-discovery-10283) 
* [LEGO NASA Apollo Saturn V](https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/lego-nasa-apollo-saturn-v-92176)
* [LEGO Land Rover Defender](https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/land-rover-defender-42110) 
* [LEGO Dinosaur Fossils](https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/dinosaur-fossils-21320) 
* A few other small LEGO sets / minifigs / misc things.

## Conclusion

So, that's the current state of my collection. My shelves are full, my to-read area is full, it's all full! 

In a follow-up post, I'll cover the how, why, and where of collecting all these books. This post serves as a baseline I can compare against in a few years when I've more space (and books!).
