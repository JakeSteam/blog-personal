intro

The games are in descending order of "fun", and might contain mild spoilers:

## #1: SpinCraft: RogueLike - [Download](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sneakypanda.spincraft)

Slots games have always been a bit of a guilty pleasure, to the extent that I even made an unsuccessful slot-based RPG [Blacksmith Slots](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.jakelee.blacksmithslots). Unfortunately most slots games are pretty predatory, force you to pay real money to make any progress, or just having a boring slick casino theme. Luckily, there's a related genre of games where you build a deck of items that can appear in your slots, which tend to be a lot more creative and interesting: SpinCraft is an excellent example of this.

### Review

To summarise the gameplay, you are spinning a slot machine. After each spin, you can choose a new symbol to add to your deck. These items interact with each other (e.g. monkey eats banana, zookeeper collects monkey, potions improve drops), and every 10-20 spins you need to make a certain amount of money to progress to the next level. Each stage has a fixed number of levels, and the money required increases by 10-40% each level.

SpinCraft ([subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpinCraft/)) relies on multiple playthroughs, both to level up your permanent items and to experiment with item combos. My first few games were... pretty short, as I was just blindly picking items I liked the look of (cats!). After a few games though, you'll learn which items work well together, and avoid wasting your picks. 

This core gameplay loop is very smooth, with complex, layered interactions between items in the slot. For example, an **arrow** might multiply all scores in the row, whilst a **cheerleader** boosts a **zookeeper** who collects a **monkey** who has just collected a **half coconut** that has come from a **coconut** that came from a **palm tree**. And that's just 1 item on the board! Item merging, dice rolling, and items dispensing items means every single spin is very unpredictable. 

Of course, it's also a roguelike. Whilst many items (e.g. +1 to every gummy bear) will be earned each game, permanent items are opened from chests instead, and can be extremely powerful. Permanent items typically massively boost earnings from certain items, provide free items every X spins, or improve chances of certain drops. These chests are earned idly over time, or from levelling up using XP earned from games.

The depth in the interactions is addictive, as is the improvement in both items and knowledge after every run. However once you know which interactions work, and which rare symbols you need for a successful run, all other runs feel a bit pointless. The first 15 spins are basically just killing time until the decent symbols start dropping. Luckily these interactions are very reliable and understandable, with the only bugs being UI based. 

Overall SpinCraft has completely sucked me in, and I'm playing it waaaay too much currently! I'm currently on World 14 and have unlocked every symbol (140+!) and permanent item (50+!), unfortunately it looks like there's nothing else to unlock.

### Monetisation

The monetisation is very, very optional, and realistically there's only 1 thing worth buying: The starter deal. For £2.69 ($3.40) you get 500 gems (worth £3.50ish), the highest level chest (worth £10 of gems), and the infrequent in-game adverts removed forever. An easy buy! 

Whilst you can buy gems via microtransactions to buy more gems, you really don't need them. It took me a couple of days to unlock all the content and hit the "wall" of level 13/14 where the money required ramps up insanely.

### Tips

* There is *another* game called "SpinCraft" on the store! I originally downloaded that and didn't understand all the hype... this one is much better!
* You need to be earning more every spin to keep up with payments. This means one-off payments are not helpful, you need to use things like egg basket / zookeeper / juice lady that pay more and more over time.
* For me, the best tactic was to try and get 2 of these "accumulator" symbols, then every spin dump more fruits / animals into them.
* Bowling balls & pins are amazing early-mid game, especially if you have "The Dude" item to double bowling ball effectiveness.
* Make sure every pick improves your earnings *somehow*. For example make sure you have the egg & seahorse collecting items, AND the ones that increase earnings with every skip. This way, even if none of the items work for you, you still get better.
* Save your rerolls for when going to a new level or spinning with a guaranteed epic.
* Delete old items if they're not working, it's fine to change tactics mid-game.
* Legendaries with negative trade-offs (e.g. Monk with gold cost, Dragon with negative symbols) are rarely worth it.
* The "First place" item (+8 every item) is bugged, and the animation will play 10 times. This means it might not be worth using, since it's pretty frustrating waiting for the animation every time!

## Conclusion

Unsurprisingly, 4 of the 5 games I've been playing a lot recently are idle to various degrees, with the outlier (Solitaire Golden Prairies) being very casual. This is obviously a persistent trend throughout my game posts (e.g., [May](https://jakelee.co.uk/my-may-top-4-android-games/), [June](https://jakelee.co.uk/my-june-top-4-android-games/)), and I doubt it'll change anytime soon!

Perhaps more interesting is that I've spent real money on all of these games. Usually <£5 in total, and almost always for permanent boosts, but it's still more than I usually spend.
