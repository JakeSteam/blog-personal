In April 2024, Reddit added 18 achievements to the mobile app, grouped into 3 categories (and added many more & outfits later). Here's all the details, and how to unlock all 65 achievements!

## What are achievements?

Whilst completing common activities within the Reddit app, you'll occasionally see a small pop-up in the middle of the screen informing you that a new achievement has been unlocked. Tapping this will take you to the "Achievements" screen, also accessible by tapping your icon in the top right and selecting "Achievements".

Some of these achievements are unlocked based on past activity (e.g. I unlocked "Nice Comment" on a 6-year-old post), whilst others always need to be earned (e.g. "Search Explorer" for tapping search results). Each has a somewhat arbitrary rarity of "Common", "Rare", "Epic", or "Legendary".

Most are pretty straightforward, and I unlocked all in the initial batch except the streak awards within a few minutes. The streak awards require up to 1000 days of daily activity, so for now they're still locked for me!

A later update added displaying the "Top X%" achievements next to a user's name when they post / comment in the subreddit they earned the achievement in:

Interestingly, if you view an achievement, you can see the comment / subreddit that earned you the achievement, as well as what number user you were to unlock it. Finally, you can also share an earned achievement (or current streak), giving you an image (with toggleable username & avatar) to post... on Reddit?

You can also view other people's achievements via their profile in the app or on ["sh.reddit.com"](https://sh.reddit.com).

## Does anyone hunt them?

A whole community of active achievement hunters has sprung up at [r/redditachievments](https://reddit.com/r/Redditachievments/)!

Over there, tactics for unlocking achievements are discussed, along with updates on new achievements, and even a weekly leaderboard of top achievement hunters. Moderators (especially [u/RossTheRev](https://www.reddit.com/user/RossTheRev)) keep an eagle eye out for any new content, and maintain their own achievement list & help others achieve.

The subreddit has been invaluable for this article, and I usually hear about new achievements via it. I also use it to find users with rarer achievements so I can get screenshots!

## Outfits?

Yep! An update in October 2024 made one achievement in each category unlock an "outfit" of 7 items for your reddit avatar (left item, right item, hat, glasses, face, top, bottom). These are limited to 25,000 redeems.

## Building Community (16)

These are tricky to earn! They require long-term commitment to a single community, and a later update added progress indicators:

[![Community progress indicator](/assets/images/2024/reddit-progress-indicator-thumbnail.png)](/assets/images/2024/reddit-progress-indicator.png)

Note the 10% achievements are _more_ common than the 25% achievements (Rare vs Legendary) due to being released far earlier.

[^unusualquantity]: This accolade previously had the description "_Be in the top 1% of upvoted commenters or posters in a subreddit for 5 months in the last year_", and may still have the same unlock requirements.

## Reddit Streak (19)

The streak achievements are simple loyalty rewards, requiring some sort of active action every day for weeks on end. This is the only achievement category to have a progress indicator at the top, in addition to the usual per-achievement progress:

Note that two of these achievements cannot be obtained yet, with the 800-day achievement being unlockable in late January.

## Exploration (22)

These achievements are a little more challenging, with 100,000 upvotes being almost impossible! Interestingly, past posts and comments often are included in this, so you might rediscover a popular post you made years ago.

The sharing achievements can actually be obtained easily, by just tapping "share" and "copy link" repeatedly on the mobile app. As such, 1,000 shares will take 10-15 minutes of dedicated tapping.

Since the banana achievements are relatively new (late October 2024), I'm not sure exactly how far 1 million banana lengths is! There is also a daily limit of 20,000 per day.

## Getting Started (7)

These are all very simple achievements that you'll probably earn in your first time using the Reddit app! Historical actions don't count, so you'll need to repeat actions if you've completed them in the past (e.g. joining a subreddit).

## Moderation (1)

In July 2025 an "Alumni Mod" Legendary achievement appeared on Reddit CEO u/spez's profile, eventually becoming [unlockable by other users](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/37281225195156-What-s-an-alumni-mod) by submitting a request to Mod Support. This achievement is semi-unofficial, as it does not appear in the achievement list until earned

Moderators can also earn subreddit-specific moderation achievements, however these do not appear on user profiles (yet) so are not included in this article. There is a (very) [detailed guide on the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Redditachievments/comments/1oeffsu/info_faq_new_community_moderation_aka_mod_toolkit/).
