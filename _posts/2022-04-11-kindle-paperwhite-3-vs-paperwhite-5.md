As must be obvious by now from the [many](/current-book-collection-and-organisation/) [book-related](/analysing-5-years-of-amazon-kindle-reading/) [posts](/analysing-my-goodreads-book-history/) on here, I love reading. After using my beloved Paperwhite 3 for 30-60 minutes a day, I decided it was time to treat myself to an upgrade. Before I give the still very capable older Kindle away, here's a visual comparison!  

The main thing I've noticed since upgrading is the new Kindle actually feels like a paperback book. The slightly increased size (whilst still being slim) and reduced bezels mean you can finally get a page of text on the screen. 

If you've ever moved from a 24" to 27" screen, or 1080p to 1440p, you'll know how having even a little bit more screen space can drastically improve your experience, and make it impossible to move back. Whilst my Paperwhite 3 seemed fine for years, as soon as I used a Paperwhite 5 it now feels very cramped. Oops.

## Key differences

Whilst every review and the store listings themselves will show the differences, here's the ones that have stood out to me:

| | Paperwhite 3 | Paperwhite 5 | Notes |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Frontlight LEDs | 4 | 17 | This noticeably improves the evenness of the backlight. |
| USB | Micro USB | USB-C | Finally, this was my last Micro USB device! | 
| Lighting warmth options | No | Yes | This option definitely helps personalise the screen appearance. |
| Screen size | 6 inch | 6.8 inch | My favourite change, much nicer. |
| Screen | Indented | Flush | The only downside, the new screen is fingerprint prone and you'll initially touch it accidentally. |

There's also overall performance improvements, with page turns being *much* speedier. However, I have noticed a rare software bug (2x in 20+ hours) where changing page will take over a second. Interestingly, this is only so noticeable because of the usually buttery fast page turns.

The difference in page turn speeds is a massive quality of life improvement. Before, there was a subconscious 300ms pause or so before I could start reading the next page, now it's 50-100ms, meaning essentially no pause between pages. Perfect when racing through an engaging section of a book! 

## Visual comparison (to books)

| Scenario | Comparison | Notes |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Size comparison | [![](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-book-thumbnail.jpg)](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-book.jpg) | I've used 2 Penguin classics as "relatable" sizes. Essentially the Paperwhite 5 is slightly smaller than a typical paperback book, and the same size as the older, small paperbacks. |
| Paperwhite 3 | [![](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-book-pw3-thumbnail.jpg)](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-book-pw3.jpg) | As shown, you can fit 60-70% of a typical paperback page onto a Paperwhite 3 (font size 2, small margins, medium spacing) |
| Paperwhite 5 | [![](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-book-pw5-thumbnail.jpg)](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-book-pw5.jpg) | However with a Paperwhite 5 you can fit roughly a whole page on the screen at once (font size 2, small margins, medium spacing)! |

## Visual comparison (without case)

| Scenario | Comparison | Notes |
| -- | -- | -- |
| From bottom | [![](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-nocase-bottom-thumbnail.jpg)](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-nocase-bottom.jpg) | They're pretty much identical from the bottom, although the Paperwhite 3 does have that odd "bump" whilst the Paperwhite 5 is a smooth surface. The 3's screen is also indented. |
| From back | [![](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-nocase-back-thumbnail.jpg)](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-nocase-back.jpg) | Farewell, Amazon logo! The minimalistic arrow is a small, but nice change. |
| Screen (no warmth) | [![](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-screen-nowarmth-thumbnail.jpg)](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-screen-nowarmth.jpg) | The difference in screen tone isn't as noticeable in person! The Paperwhite 3's screen looks similar to Paperwhite 5's warmth level 1-2. |
| Screen (my preferred warmth) | [![](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-screen-normal-thumbnail.jpg)](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-screen-normal.jpg) | I read at warmth level 3, to me it looks like a brand new paperback book. |
| Screen (max warmth) | [![](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-screen-fullwarmth-thumbnail.jpg)](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-screen-fullwarmth.jpg) | Surely reading like this is impossible! However, here's the maximum warmth just for comparison. |

## Visual comparison (with case)

For my Paperwhite 3 I've got a pretty standard [FINTIE case](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00JPB83T0/), whilst my [Paperwhite 5 Kids](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/kindle-paperwhite-kids-includes-over-a-thousand-books-a-child-friendly-cover-and-a-2-year-worry-free-guarantee-robot-dreams/dp/B08WPJMC44/) came with a free black case.

| Scenario | Comparison | Notes |
| -- | -- | -- |
| From bottom | [![](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-case-bottom-thumbnail.jpg)](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-case-bottom.jpg) | The official Amazon case is a bit bulkier when open, but feels sturdier. |
| Side by side | [![](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-case-sidebyside-thumbnail.jpg)](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-case-sidebyside.jpg) | No real differences from this angle, besides the obvious screen size. |
| Side by side (with case open) | [![](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-case-sidebyside2-thumbnail.jpg)](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-case-sidebyside2.jpg) | Not a very fair comparison since my Paperwhite 3's case has had years of use! Unsurprisingly they're pretty similar, although it is nice having a magnetised cover without requiring a little "ridge". |

## Battery

After using the Paperwhite 5 for a few weeks, the battery life felt slightly better. However, since the battery had only dropped by 30-40% in this time, it's hard to tell! You'll also see a battery drop when you add new books, since they have to be indexed initially. Nothing to worry about, after a few days the battery life improves.

A very unofficial test was conducted by:

1. Setting brightness to maximum.
2. Turn on Wi-Fi.
3. Leaving the screen on the library.
4. Swiping to change page once every 2 minutes (to avoid screen timeout).
5. Waiting for the battery to drop 1%.

| Device | Time |
| -- | -- |
| Paperwhite 3 | 8m 59s |
| Paperwhite 5 | 13m 46s |

Pretty conclusive results! Of course, whilst the Paperwhite 5's battery is better, I suspect a lot of this battery life difference is down to just being a brand new battery. Still, it's good to see the larger screen, more RAM, and more LEDs aren't having a noticeable impact on battery.

There's also a "Power Saver" mode that was on by default on my new device, and I've left on. It means the screen takes 2-3 seconds to turn on, but seems to make no actual difference in usage. Given any Paperwhite lasts multiple weeks of usage anyway (Amazon state 10, at 30m/day), the power saver mode probably isn't necessary! 

Finally, these numbers are obviously worst case scenario. I use brightness 9 usually, but 24 for the test, and keep airplane mode on. 

## Purchasing

I wanted to point out [Kindle Paperwhite Kids](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/kindle-paperwhite-kids-includes-over-a-thousand-books-a-child-friendly-cover-and-a-2-year-worry-free-guarantee-emerald-forest/dp/B08WPQFP44). This package is *identical* to the Kindle Paperwhite w/o Ads, with free:

1. Choice of black / forest / robot case
2. 1 year's access to Amazon Kids+

I don't have children, so it's essentially a free Kindle cover. This package is currently on sale for £95 which is amazingly cheap, I thought it was a good deal at the £140 I paid! 

## Conclusion

Overall, the Paperwhite 5 is a great device. It improves in almost every aspect over the Paperwhite 3, with the small downsides being debatable (screen flush vs indented), and a drastically improved reading experience.

One of the concerns I had, and often see online, is the Kindle being too large / bezels being too small to use in one hand. Luckily, this isn't the case. I always read with one hand, tapping with the thumb, and this is pretty much identical with the new Kindle.

If you use a Kindle regularly, and don't have an Oasis, I'd definitely recommend giving the new Paperwhite a go!
