Forza Horizon 5 has a lot of cars: over 800 by now. Whilst most of these are very sensible, some are more useful for driving backwards, wheelies, or just looking very silly!

Whilst humour is subjective, I'm British so unsurprisingly enjoy a bit of slapstick, a bit of absurdist, and a [bit of shitshow comedy](/the-irresistible-allure-of-shitshow-comedy/). Luckily, Forza can offer all of these if you look hard enough, and combining a stupid car, livery, outfit, and horn can make you the laughingstock of a race. Perfect.

I've linked the Forza wiki article for all of these, which contains information on how to obtain each. Some might be DLC or very expensive, sorry!

## Cars

### Small cars

The tiny cars are a Forza classic comedy car, and their handling is usually so chaotic that they're only really usable in Playground Games events. They become bizarrely competitive in this context, since they have great acceleration and are tricky to hunt down. There's nothing more frustrating than trying to chase another player carrying the flag, and they're a tiny little ping pong ball!

**[1957 BMW Isetta 300 Export](https://forza.fandom.com/wiki/BMW_Isetta_300_Export)**

The mildest of the small silly cars, the Isetta is actually pretty driveable! Mine is S1 class, with a beautiful golden livery.

**[1962 Peel P50](https://forza.fandom.com/wiki/Peel_P50)**

Awful at high speeds, but can turn on a dime, the P50 is very bouncy and has _so_ many custom liveries. Mine is Thomas the Tank Engine.

**[1965 Peel Trident](https://forza.fandom.com/wiki/Peel_Trident)**

A bit smoother to drive the P50, and looks like a spaceship regardless of livery. Mine is a tasty burger.

### Big cars

There is something very satisfying about racing using a car twice the size of everyone else, and _winning_. Hopefully the others find the massive vehicles as entertaining!

**[2014 Mercedes-Benz Unimog U5023](https://forza.fandom.com/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_Unimog_U5023)**

Perhaps the biggest canvas in FH5, liveries have absolutely tons of space to work with on a Unimog. Not only is the entire back storage unit paintable, the cab can be painted too. Mine is China Post themed.

**[2015 Mercedes-Benz Tankpool24](https://forza.fandom.com/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_24_Tankpool24_Racing_Truck)**

I love the Tankpool truck, since it provides lots of space for a livery, is very visible, can nudge any other car aside, yet still has decent performance. Oh, and [truck racing is a real thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnHWL-J-3KE)!

[![](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-tankpool.png)](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-tankpool.png)

### Hot Wheels cars

Most of the Hot Wheels cars look a little odd, but these 4 are completely ridiculous. They're not seen very often, as they are mostly DLC cars without great stats.

**[1957 Nash Metropolitan Custom](https://forza.fandom.com/wiki/Hot_Wheels_Nash_Metropolitan_Custom)**

At first glance the Nash Metropolitan looks relatively normal. However, a second glance will reveal the oversized tyres, the oddly rounded edges, and an engine that completely obscures the driver's view. This is perhaps the only Hot Wheels car that still looks like a small toy car, even in a realistic setting.

[![](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-nash.png)](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-nash.png)

**[2000 Deora II](https://forza.fandom.com/wiki/Hot_Wheels_Deora_II)**

Just a truly bizarre car shape. Is it a truck? A transport capsule? No, just an oddity.

[![](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-deora.png)](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-deora.png)

**[2012 Bad To The Blade](https://forza.fandom.com/wiki/Hot_Wheels_Bad_to_the_Blade)**

A criminally underutilised car, it actually has pretty decent performance. Unfortunately the highly angular design leads to quite limited liveries. It's like driving a crumpled up pieces of paper.

[![](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-bad.png)](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-bad.png)

**[2018 2JetZ](https://forza.fandom.com/wiki/Hot_Wheels_2JetZ)**

Some aspects of the 2JetZ aren't too unusual, but the overall structure is unlike anything else I've seen. Plenty of surface area also means decent liveries.

[![](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-2jetz.png)](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-2jetz.png)

### Wheelie-ing cars

Whilst quite a few cars in the game can pop a wheelie, there are my 4 favourites. Each of these could be the best Forza Horizon 5 wheelie cars, with different styles of wheelie. I've also included the tune sharing code for each.

**[1970 GMC Jimmy](https://forza.fandom.com/wiki/GMC_Jimmy)**

Perhaps the best handling wheelie-able car, the Jimmy can still drive relatively normally, only hopping up on 2 wheels under extreme acceleration. I used tune `483 642 150`.

[![](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-jimmy.png)](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-jimmy.png)

**[1971 Meyers Manx](https://forza.fandom.com/wiki/Meyers_Manx)**

The Meyers Manx is completely undriveable with the tune `641 925 306`! Even tapping the accelerator will fling the car up even further than the back 2 wheels, onto the bumper. Even at very low speeds, the car's front will seem to "float" upwards when turning, good luck driving this!
ridiculous non stop wheelies

[![](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-meyers.png)](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-meyers.png)

**[1972 Reliant Supervan III](https://forza.fandom.com/wiki/Reliant_Supervan_III)**

The Reliant Supervan is quite good at wheelies. It's also quite good at rolling over on it's side. In fact, it's very good at not staying upright! I used tune `130 845 983` and any acceleration resulted in unexpected barrel rolls.

[![](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-supervan.png)](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-supervan.png)

**[1973 AMC Gremlin X](https://forza.fandom.com/wiki/AMC_Gremlin_X)**

A classic wheelie car, the AMC Gremlin X reliably jumps up on 2 wheels under sustained acceleration even in low classes, yet still handles well. I used tune `453 743 425`.

[![](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-gremlin.png)](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-gremlin.png)

### Other cars

**[1958 Austin-Healey Sprite Mk1](https://forza.fandom.com/wiki/Austin-Healey_Sprite_MkI)**

The Sprite Mk1 has a cute little face! What more needs to be said?

[![](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-sprite.png)](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-sprite.png)

**[2013 Cadillac XTS Limousine](https://forza.fandom.com/wiki/Cadillac_XTS_Limousine)**

Limos are fun. The Cadillac can drift pretty well, and also handles essentially the same as a normal car, but is just a little bit longer.

[![](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-limo.png)](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-limo.png)

**[2016 Koenigsegg Regera](https://forza.fandom.com/wiki/Koenigsegg_Regera)**

Ever wanted to drive a car around 200mph backwards? Good news, electric cars in Forza Horizon 5 provide this opportunity! As Forza uses 1st gear for reverse handling, the single-geared electric cars can reach the same speeds backwards as forwards. The fastest backwards car is the Regera, although handling at high speeds is pretty tricky.

[![](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-regera.png)](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-regera.png)

**[2022 Fast & Furious Flip Car 2.0](https://forza.fandom.com/wiki/Fast_and_Furious_Flip_Car_2.0_%27Fast_X%27)**

I hesitated to include the Flip Car, since it is _designed_ to be ridiculous. The "flip" functionality doesn't actually work, and cars don't slide up the front of it. Still, the excessive length makes an entertaining drive.

[![](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-flip.png)](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-flip.png)

**[2554 AMG Transport Dynamics M12S Warthog CST](https://forza.fandom.com/wiki/AMG_Transport_Dynamics_M12S_Warthog_CST)**

A recurring odd car in Forza Horizon games, the Warthog handles well considering the size. Very bouncy, but I hesitate to use it since it's odd by design.

[![](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-warthog.png)](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-warthog.png)

## Liveries

When playing online, especially during The Trial, this is your opportunity to make the races a little bit more entertaining. Rolling up to a race looking awful is my favourite part of the Festival Playlist.

**Neon colours**

Extremely bright colours that hurt the eyes? Perfect. This can be done without installing a livery, and just painting body parts.

[![](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-neon.png)](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-neon.png)

**Pop culture**

I don't use this genre of liveries, since it ends up annoying me more than entertaining. Every car will have hundreds of liveries with PokÃ©mon, Among Us, Family Guy, Futurama etc stuck on.

[![](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-popculture.png)](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-popculture.png)

**Sleeper cars**

Even though outside appearances mean nothing in Forza, players still underestimate cars that look run-down or rusted. As such, I often drive vehicles with rusty liveries applied, making first place even more satisfying.

[![](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-sleeper.png)](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-sleeper.png)

**Setting appropriate**

Finally, some cars have liveries that instead of looking ridiculous, actually fit into the Mexico environment. Taxis, emergency services, and countless other liveries appropriate for the surroundings are available.

[![](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-appropriate.png)](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-appropriate.png)

## Outfits

When you first start playing Forza, the seemingly endless cosmetic unlocks on wheelspins can be annoying. Yet another dull t-shirt is not a very appealing reward. However, there are full body costumes that are much more entertaining!

**Tankito Doritos**

This limited edition unlock [from October 2022](/complete-guide-to-fh5-secret-dlc-cars/#secret-outfit-oct-22) is the most out of place outfit in the entire game. As such, it's what I always use, especially as there is no way the driver can see a thing.

[![](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-doritos.png)](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-doritos.png)

**Gingerbread Outfit**

Very out of place, even during the Christmas season it is unlocked during.

[![](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-gingerbread.png)](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-gingerbread.png)

**Dinosaur Outfit**

Whilst the dinosaur outfit could have been an excellent oddity, the player's face is visible ruining the overall effect!

[![](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-dinosaur.png)](/assets/images/2024/fh5c-dinosaur.png)

## Conclusion

Once you've put enough hours into Forza Horizon 5 (I'm almost at 1000!), it can get a little bit repetitive. Mixing it up by taking the game even less seriously and trying to drive around in something ridiculous helps, and can lead to surreal interactions with other players if they're also driving something odd.

If you ever spot me in-game I'll look awful, at the very least in my Tankito Doritos outfit. This is definitely not Forza Motorsport, and I'm very grateful a bit of absurdity is possible!
