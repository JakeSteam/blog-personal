Every December since 2011, The Yogscast have organised the "Jingle Jam", a collection of streams with [an associated bundle](https://jinglejam.tiltify.com/) with £1100+ of great games to raise money for charity. I'm reviewing all 75 of them, hopefully finding a few new favourites! Here's part 2 with the next 30 games. 

## Rating system

I'll be using the same rating system as last year, essentially it's purely how much I personally enjoy the game, not whether it's good or not. As such, a great game might get a 1/5 if it's not a genre I enjoy, and vice versa. It's the only way to give an honest review!

* **5/5**: I had to stop myself playing this game, I'm very likely to replay this later and complete it.
* **4/5**: This was a good experience, but maybe had problems. I'll likely play it again for a little bit eventually.
* **3/5**: The game was OK. Maybe it was a bit flawed, or just obviously bad game design decisions. I'm unlikely to play it again, but didn't actively dislike it. 
* **2/5**: This was not fun. Maybe it has some positive parts, but overall I didn't enjoy my time playing.
* **1/5**: The game experience was actively unpleasant. I had to force myself to play more than a few minutes of it, and was relieved when I finally closed the game. 

I played most games for at least an hour, but some are pretty small and understood / completed after 15-20 minutes. Information on peak player count are [from SteamDB.info](https://steamdb.info/).

## 5/5 Games

### Make Way

| Steam rating | Price | Description | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [82.80% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1445790) | £12.99 | Chaotic Creative Racing | December 2023 | 139 (December 2023) |

A multiplayer only game that... I enjoy!? 

Make Way is a racing game where you create the track between each round. The controls are super simple (accelerate, steer!), the balance between chaos and control is perfect, and the track pieces are unique.

I was concerned that I'd be unable to play Make Way without friends, but the queuing system found me a match within a couple of seconds. We both readied up, and played a complete game with zero issues throughout. I assume the other player was quite new to, since it was a pretty close battle.

Points are rewards just for *finishing* a section, with a bonus for first place. Whilst this seems like it might encourage safe and boring driving, it is countered by any slow players being killed until the next checkpoint. This means everyone has to keep up to earn any points, and there is a strong incentive to barge the other drivers whenever possible!

During my online match, we both won a few rounds, and there's not much opportunity to *properly* screw each other over, since what's more important is keeping yourself on the track. As such, if you try to do more than a gentle nudge down the straight you'll find yourself spinning out and losing points. 

I absolutely loved Make Way, and the progression system (play more = unlock more track pieces) and challenges (play with a specific car, do jumps, etc) ensure I'll definitely be coming back after Jingle Jam. I really hope the multiplayer community survives, since the game would lose a lot of its appeal if the races were against AI. Pushing a player off the track is far more fun!

## 4/5 Games

### Ikonei Island

| Steam rating | Price | Description | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [78.97% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1550730) | £20.99 | Cozy Island Crafting | November 2023 | 140 (November 2023) |

This is one of those games that I just *know* I could get totally sucked into. In Ikonei Island, you're exploring an island, and doing all the crafting, exploring, and combat you'd expect.

The characters weren't very relatable (alien children?), but the overall aesthetic reminded me a bit of games like Slime Rancher. You're given a decent degree of freedom, whilst still having guidance on what you need to do to progress. I started upgrading my house, and it provides a hint towards what items you'll eventually need.

Whilst I played single player (as usual), the store page lists an amazing feature where friends can play for free so long as *one* of you owns the game! This even applies to the 2 hour demo, a great way to get new groups of friends signed up.

### LOUD

| Steam rating | Price | Description | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [83.41% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1838290) | £3.40 | Teenage Rhythm Story | February 2023 | 28 (April 2023) |

I was sure I was going to hate this. The intro was very teenage girl angst, and I'm neither of those things!

However, once the game actually started up... I really liked it? The controls were one of the most intuitive I've seen in a rhythm game, with D-pad up/left/down being the 3 bars on the left, and Y/B/A being the 3 bars on the right. Things are arranged on-screen how they are on my controller, perfect!

The songs are very nostalgic if you're in your 20s / early 30s, it's essentially Blink-182 without any vocals. I've got a soft spot for the post-punk style songs, and they work really well with the "hit the button at the right time" gameplay. There's pretty standard variations (hold and mash), and they all have distinct colours and styles.

I completed the "bedroom" set of levels, and on the easiest difficulty it was definitely getting towards the limits of my own ability. Concentrating on 6 areas of the screen at once is tricky, and I'm terrified of how the difficulty will ramp up later on.

This would have been a 5/5 game if it wasn't for the cutscenes & overall story that are very teenage focussed. Unfortunately it's hard to *love* a game where I can't relate to the story at all.

### Imp of the Sun

| Steam rating | Price | Description | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [70.64% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1535780) | £15.99 | Incan Puzzles & Brawling | March 2022 | 20 (March 2022) |

This was a fun little puzzler! The puzzles in the first couple of areas were pretty simple, consisting of basic platforming and target hunting. Movement is pretty fluid, although the hitboxes of enemies and bosses can be a bit unclear. This led to quite a few accidental hits when I was standing too close to a boss.

The dialog is a bit slow to get through, but it does help build up the overall Amazonian atmosphere.

Overall I'd like to come back and spend more time working through the puzzles, although I do wonder whether it can continue to build on the basic foundations so far.

## 3/5 Games

### Lacuna

| Steam rating | Price | Description | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [88.41% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1364100) | £12.39 | Pixel Noir Detective | May 2021 | 218 (May 2022) |

As with a lot of story driven games, it's hard to review this after a short period of gameplay.

The initial intro is relatively interesting, but I found movement a bit too slow and repetitive to really get too invested. Additionally, there's quite a few walls of text that you just have to sit through, not particularly engaging.

The pixel art is absolutely beautiful, and I suspect there's a very, very good game inside here if you're willing to invest the time.

### Marble World

| Steam rating | Price | Description | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [84.77% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1491340) | £9.49 | Marble Building & Watching | September 2022 | 124 (May 2021) |

The good bit of Marble World? The ability to utilise your creativity in making tracks. The bad bit of Marble World? The requirement of creativity.

Whilst Steam Workshop support gives the game potential, I'm just not sure that I'd get any enjoyment out of either making or playing tracks. It's more of a simulator than an actual game.

This is definitely one of those games where watching a streamer play an existing track with marbles named after subscribers is *way* more fun than actually creating or playing the tracks yourself. I've watched a fair bit of [Wirtual playing](https://www.youtube.com/@WirtualTV/search?query=marble) a similar game, [Marbles on Stream](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1170970/Marbles_on_Stream/). Whilst that game presumably lacks some features... it looks pretty similar, is free, and has heavy Twitch integration.

### Mars Horizon

| Steam rating | Price | Description | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [81.03% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/765810) | £14.99 | Space Program Simulator | November 2020 | 2,525 (November 2020) |

Mars Horizon is a pretty interesting space management simulator. All the typical elements are here, researching rocket parts, building your base, competing for milestones and funding.

I really appreciated the choice of starting agencies, most space games have only ever heard of NASA! However, the tutorial's infodump was a bit relentless, and it took me a few minutes to find out what the core of the game actually was. Once I got there, I'm not sure how much I was into it.

The gameplay is more of a "pick research and wait" simulator than anything else, with no active gameplay. Whilst the lack of timers is generally a positive, making a decision or two then waiting a month doesn't feel very satisfying. 

If you want to roleplay as SpaceX, this is your game. If you want to... do some gaming, maybe not.

### Monster Prom

| Steam rating | Price | Description | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [90.86% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/743450) | £9.29 | Monster Dating Sim | April 2018 | 1,510 (April 2018) |

I'm not the biggest fan of dating sims. Still, if they can be "won" by picking sensible choices, they become a bit more like a logic puzzle and I can get into them.

Monster Prom is definitely not one of these. Outcomes are essentially random, with no way to tell who will be at a location or what will happen there. As such, you might be trying to date character A, but accidentally barely meet them! 

The writing, art, and voice acting is undeniably interesting. It's somewhat chaotic, with references to bitcoin, feminism, capitalism, and everything inbetween. However, the randomness of any conversation's outcome makes it a little annoying if you're actually trying to progress with a specific character.

There definitely seems like a lot of depth here, and I can see how this would be a cult classic. For me though? I'm just not super interested in a random dating sim, monsters or not.

Still, I appreciate the ability to choose a short or long playthrough at the start.

### Longvinter

| Steam rating | Price | Description | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [67.55% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1635450) | £13.99 | Multiplayer Crafting Islands | February 2022 | 1,441 (January 2023) |

Where's the game?

No official servers, no unofficial servers, no modded servers, nothing seems available in my region (UK). OK, so what about single player... well, you can make a server, but the progress will be totally wiped next time you start the game.

Finally get into actual gameplay, and it's just wandering around, collecting things, selling things, buying things. I'm guessing there's a competent game here, but for whatever reason it totally wasn't present for me. A very empty world, that feels lifeless despite the soft and cuddly aesthetic.

As a side note, it's pretty sloppy that a command prompt opens up whilst start a local server (the only way to play), with thousands of lines of dev logs. I should not ever see these.

Early access, so hopefully it becomes an actual competent game eventually.

### MetaPhysical

| [78.75% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1568620) | £9.29 | Supernatural Ghost Hunt | October 2021 | 57 (December 2022) |

What a frustrating game. The UI has never heard of information overload, happily dumping screens of buttons at you. Contrastingly, the actual game has never heard of moonlight: hope you enjoy pitch black!

Anyway, it's a ghost hunting game. Remember Phasmophobia? It's that but jankier.

Upon entering the tutorial house (after painfully purchasing and picking up an assortment of items), I blundered around until I found a light switch. I flicked light switches as I found them, and they seemed to turn lights on or off completely at random. 

Oh, but I have a flashlight! Never mind, it seems to bug out half the time and not actually show anything. Spooky sound effects play at random and overlap, I've no idea what's intentionally unsettling and what's just poorly implemented.

Presumably there's some fun to be had here in multiplayer, but I will not be opening it again.
