Every December since 2011, The Yogscast have organised the "Jingle Jam", a collection of streams with [an associated bundle](https://jinglejam.tiltify.com/) with £1100+ of great games to raise money for charity. I'm reviewing all 75 of them, hopefully finding a few new favourites! Here's part 2 with the next 30 games. 

## Rating system

I'll be using the same rating system as last year, essentially it's purely how much I personally enjoy the game, not whether it's good or not. As such, a great game might get a 1/5 if it's not a genre I enjoy, and vice versa. It's the only way to give an honest review!

* **5/5**: I had to stop myself playing this game, I'm very likely to replay this later and complete it.
* **4/5**: This was a good experience, but maybe had problems. I'll likely play it again for a little bit eventually.
* **3/5**: The game was OK. Maybe it was a bit flawed, or just obviously bad game design decisions. I'm unlikely to play it again, but didn't actively dislike it. 
* **2/5**: This was not fun. Maybe it has some positive parts, but overall I didn't enjoy my time playing.
* **1/5**: The game experience was actively unpleasant. I had to force myself to play more than a few minutes of it, and was relieved when I finally closed the game. 

I played most games for at least an hour, but some are pretty small and understood / completed after 15-20 minutes. Information on peak player count are [from SteamDB.info](https://steamdb.info/).

### LOUD

| [83.41% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1838290) | £3.40 | Teenage Rhythm Story | February 2023 | 28 (April 2023) |

I was sure I was going to hate this. The intro was very teenage girl angst, and I'm neither of those things!

However, once the game actually started up... I really liked it? The controls were one of the most intuitive I've seen in a rhythm game, with D-pad up/left/down being the 3 bars on the left, and Y/B/A being the 3 bars on the right. Things are arranged on-screen how they are on my controller, perfect!

The songs are very nostalgic if you're in your 20s / early 30s, it's essentially Blink-182 without any vocals. I've got a soft spot for the post-punk style songs, and they work really well with the "hit the button at the right time" gameplay. There's pretty standard variations (hold and mash), and they all have distinct colours and styles.

I completed the "bedroom" set of levels, and on the easiest difficulty it was definitely getting towards the limits of my own ability. Concentrating on 6 areas of the screen at once is tricky, and I'm terrified of how the difficulty will ramp up later on.

This would have been a 5/5 game if it wasn't for the cutscenes & overall story that are very teenage focussed. Unfortunately it's hard to *love* a game where I can't relate to the story at all.

### Imp of the Sun

| Steam rating | Price | Description | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [70.64% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1535780) | £15.99 | Incan Puzzles & Brawling | March 2022 | 20 (March 2022) |

This was a fun little puzzler! The puzzles in the first couple of areas were pretty simple, consisting of basic platforming and target hunting. Movement is pretty fluid, although the hitboxes of enemies and bosses can be a bit unclear. This led to quite a few accidental hits when I was standing too close to a boss.

The dialog is a bit slow to get through, but it does help build up the overall Amazonian atmosphere.

Overall I'd like to come back and spend more time working through the puzzles, although I do wonder whether it can continue to build on the basic foundations so far.

## 3/5 Games

### Lacuna

| Steam rating | Price | Description | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [88.41% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1364100) | £12.39 | Pixel Noir Detective | May 2021 | 218 (May 2022) |

As with a lot of story driven games, it's hard to review this after a short period of gameplay.

The initial intro is relatively interesting, but I found movement a bit too slow and repetitive to really get too invested. Additionally, there's quite a few walls of text that you just have to sit through, not particularly engaging.

The pixel art is absolutely beautiful, and I suspect there's a very, very good game inside here if you're willing to invest the time.

## 1/5 Games

### Longvinter

| Steam rating | Price | Description | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [67.55% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1635450) | £13.99 | Multiplayer Crafting Islands | February 2022 | 1,441 (January 2023) |

Where's the game?

No official servers, no unofficial servers, no modded servers, nothing seems available in my region (UK). OK, so what about single player... well, you can make a server, but the progress will be totally wiped next time you start the game.

Finally get into actual gameplay, and it's just wandering around, collecting things, selling things, buying things. I'm guessing there's a competent game here, but for whatever reason it totally wasn't present for me. A very empty world, that feels lifeless despite the soft and cuddly aesthetic.

As a side note, it's pretty sloppy that a command prompt opens up whilst start a local server (the only way to play), with thousands of lines of dev logs. I should not ever see these.

Early access, so hopefully it becomes an actual competent game eventually.
