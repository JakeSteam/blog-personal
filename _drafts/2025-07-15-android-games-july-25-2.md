I'm still in my Google Play Pass month, so here are 3 more games!

## #1: [Bounty Of One](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bountyofone.premium.mobile.gp)

You know Vampire Survivors? This is an okay-ish mobile port of a wild west themed copycat!

### Review

I've got mixed feelings about Bounty Of One. On the one hand, the dopamine rush of mowing down hundreds of zombies(?) and picking upgrades and perks is undeniably satisfying. On the other hand, there's not much depth or difficulty despite all the perks and upgrades and gamemodes, and everything outside of the main game is awkward on mobile.

This isn't a particularly hard game if you've spent any time in bullet hell games, or those with the concept of "kiting" enemies. Keep moving and briefly stand still to autoshoot, avoid getting trapped by a horde, then circle back around and collect your loot. Repeat until you run out of life or kill enough bosses to win. The only slight quirk is having a "dash" skill that moves you forward, helping to escape particularly bad situations.

Whilst I do appreciate the 4 included game modes, they're all ultimately the same. Regular mode, regular mode with a time incentive, a horizontal only mode, and a small area mode. The gameplay doesn't change, only the (bland, empty) arena. The coins dropped by enemies give you XP, used to gain upgrades. Killing a harder enemy drops a chest, which has an object containing a choice of a few unique perks.

The upgrades and perks are primarily simple things like extra life, attack speed, move speed, damage, etc. Luckily, there's a solid mixture of interesting perks. They vary from projectile modifiers like bounce and penetration ot area changers like slowing enemies near you and damage amplifying lenses, to game changers like tripling your shots or firing behind you.

In addition to these, there are 12 characters to choose from, each starting with a significant perk (that can also be unlocked during a run). For example, "ROB3RT 0.3" has a constant turret but halved attack speed, whilst Tara has a small companion that collects coins to charge a high damage lazer. Unlocking these requires completing slightly challenging feats such as not moving for 60 seconds or winning at a certain difficulty.

The boss battles are decent, with multi-stage bosses requiring dodging attacks and tactical movements. However, once you've killed the 3-4 different bosses once they're not a challenge, with a no-damage kill being pretty easy next time you encounter them.

Outside the actual gameplay, the UI is clearly not made for mobile. Text is genuinely hard to see, requiring peering very closely to read the tiny characters, and presumably unreadable on smaller screens. Luckily, you won't spend much of your time in these other menus (such as a simple permanent perk shop), since there's not much there.

After a few playthroughs you'll generally know which of these perks works well with your style of gameplay, and typically win every game. There's an "infamy level" system (harder rules, but higher score) but this doesn't have a major impact if you have strong object synergy.

I've played perhaps 7-8 runs, winning 5, experienced every enemy and most objects, unlocked 11/12 characters and around half the achievements. Each of these runs takes around 15 minutes of gameplay, so within a few hours I've unfortunately seen everything the game has to offer (according to the in-game encyclopedia). Fun, but perhaps not for too long.

### Monetisation

I played this as part of Google Play Pass, I believe it is around $5 otherwise (with extra for DLCs that are included in Play Pass).

### Tips

1. Move in a wide circle if you can, stopping in sync with your attack, so you can deal constant damage and also collect all the coins.
2. When picking an upgrade, higher quality colours (e.g. legendary yellow) are almost always the correct choice.
3. Health is all that ultimately matters. As such, I try to get up to around 8 max health, and focus on anything that offers passive healing or vampire healing. After that, I focus on attack speed to avoid getting cornered.
4. Make sure you keep your damage upgraded enough to one-hit standard enemies. Without this, you'll be swarmed quite badly.
5. Personally, I found the mineshaft gamemode the most fun, with the horizontal-only gameplay forcing a bit of challenge into a playthrough. The "dynamite bombardment" event was the highest challenge experience I had in the game, and I'd have loved to see more of this.

## #2: [Homo Machina](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ArteExperience.HomoMachina)

This is an educational game about your body, but more game than education!

### Review

Humanising your body as being controlled by smaller sentient beings is nothing new, I read _tons_ of it in [comics as a kid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Numskulls)! However, Homo Machina provides a very sleek internal experience of a typical day, starting with waking up, and ending with a date.

Every step of the day, from smelling coffee and identifying it, to focusing on the date partner opposite, is presented as a standalone level. These involve solving a small puzzle to make the body part work, such as figuring out how to focus the eye's lens, or responding to nervous system triggers.

None of these are challenging, but they are all animated very well, and it's clear a lot of effort has been put into presentation. Whilst you're unlikely to learn anything knew from Homo Machina, it is a reasonable "first glance" introduction to some of the human body's parts, and could interest a younger audience in the topic.

A playthrough won't take more than half hour, with no replayability, but I'm glad educational experiences like this still get funded, despite it almost inevitably not gaining a large audience or making much revenue. Instead, it's a fun little experience for anyone who stumbles across it and decided to pay up.

### Monetisation

One-off payment of ¬£2.49 (~$3.49), currently ¬£1.49 (~$1.99).

### Tips

No need for tips, just solve each puzzle!
