### Review

If you were playing free online flash games in the early 2000s, you might immediately think that "hocus" looks like "[Bloxors](https://bloxorz.io/)", an infuriatingly hard game. Luckily, it's only similar on the surface, the gameplay is very different!

In hocus, you roll a small red cube around the level trying to get into the highlighted hole. You can't go "around" the outside of corners, but can navigate on any surface you're touching. The twist is... every level is an optical illusion, very similar to the "Impossible Triangle" ([Penrose Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_triangle)).

The truly baffling layout of each level means getting to the end is a genuine struggle. You'll work your way around a complex structure, make your way to the exit... and then realise you're on the wrong surface. Oops. Time to carry on your rolling journey and try another approach.

I'm not ashamed to admit my puzzle solving process was about 50% luck and 50% puzzle solving. I'd try to mentally work out which surfaces could get me to the exit, then how to get to those surfaces, and then wander around the level until one of them looked achievable. Or just swipe at random until I ended up somewhere interesting!

The game features 120 levels, and completing them can take either a few seconds or a few minutes each. Some of them will just "click" immediately, and others you'll go slightly insane rolling in circles seemingly endlessly. These won't take too long, and full completion took me perhaps 2-3 hours split across 2 sessions whilst watching videos.

Seems short? Well, yes, however there's also an infinite (randomly generated) mode, and an astonishingly simple yet powerful level creator! I didn't spend too much time with this, but the game's approach of technically simple layouts resulting in complicated levels means recreating any of the game's levels is very easy.

On that topic, I discovered [hocus is also on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/418040/hocus/), making it a good place for [finding custom levels](https://steamcommunity.com/app/418040/discussions/). There are also a [few on r/hocus](https://www.reddit.com/r/hocus/). Despite being originally released in 2016, and having 10m+ installs, I couldn't find any other decent sources of custom levels.

Overall, hocus will be a short but sweet puzzling experience that'll frustrate you, then reward you with a healthy dose of dopamine, 120 times. Great!

### Monetisation

I accessed hocus for free via Google Play Pass, but it looks like a one-off Â£1.99 payment unlocks the full game.

### Tips

- I found it help to think in terms of flat surfaces, not tiles, when trying to figure out a successful route.
- Swiping randomly does work if you get stuck!
- Triangles are great for getting onto another side of a cube.
- The game doesn't mislead you as much as I expected. If there's an optional triangle on your way to the exit, you'll probably need it!
- The circle at the top of the screen shows the available movement directions, early on the game this can help you understand normal movement methods.
- Due to the game's confusing perspective, never assume how 2 poles are going to interact! I often found I'd unexpectedly be able to hop from one to the other, or be blocked, so it's always worth trying out all possible routes.
