## #1: [Forest Fables](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DotDotFire.DDF2024)

Forest Fables is the most genuinely enjoyable "educational" game I have ever played. It is clearly a cosy game trying to give players a fun experience, yet sneaks in some education, and I can't stop playing it!

### Screenshots

All screenshots are from version 1.4.2:

### Review

I'm generally not interested in "cozy" games, or "life sim" games, and this is both. However, the combination of a simple gameplay loop, beautiful artwork, and an extremely fair and a non-manipulative economy culminates in what can only be described as "a nice time". I love it.

The general story is you've been kidnapped and taken to "Wildleaf Forest", where you'll spend your days wandering around locations, talking to the inhabitants, completing quests, and earning & spending money. At no point is it particularly challenging, with quests typically involving solving simple riddles, navigating conversation trees, or completing "spot the object" games in areas. These are all unique, intuitive, tracked in your quest log, and offer generous rewards.

However, this plain description doesn't do the game justice. The writing is excellent, with each character expressing their unique personality in simple conversations, and each feeling like a "real" character. Similarly, the artwork is easily amongst the best I've ever seen, with the slightly abstracted pixel art being by favourite style.

Movement in an area is only possibly by tapping on actionable items, such as NPCs, minigames (more on that next!), or quest objects. This avoids any pointless wandering around, since you'll only move when you've done something useful. The movement and style strongly reminds me of [Habbo Hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habbo), a game I played ~18 years ago, so nostalgia is definitely impacting my experience! Unlike Habbo Hotel, Forest Fables is single-player and will be a relatively short experience (likely a few days unless you get into the furniture / clothing), but that's OK!

The minigames are unlocked via keys, and none will be anything new, just solid implementations of basic minigames. Things like "tap the button at the right time to cook the croissant", or "pour the coffee ingredients without overflowing", or "pick the carrots but not the turnips". Simple games, that are short and rewarding enough to not be a chore. There is a day/night cycle, with some minigames only being accessible earlier in the day, but this doesn't affect gameplay too much.

Your motivation day-to-day is, broadly-speaking, earning and spending currencies. Whilst there does seem to be too many, it's important to highlight how absolutely optional almost all of them are, with the primary use being entirely cosmetic furniture, clothing, or houses. Whilst some currency is required for repairing your house, or completing quests, this is a negligible amount compared to the purely aesthetic items. So, how do you earn currencies?

The currencies are:

- **Energy**: Whilst this earned is 1 per 10m, it's not like normal energy! It only controls how many minigames you can play per day for coins & acorns, essentially stopping you from becoming rich instantly.
- **Acorns**: Earned through simple minigames, spent on increasing income from minigames _or_ trading for "keys".
- **Coins**: Earned through simple minigames, or savings interest, spent to repair / clean home or aesthetic items.
- **Gems**: The main premium currency. Typically purchased, with some available for free, only used for aesthetic items.
- **Keys**: The main progression system, you can exchange acorns for these, then use them to unlock new areas / minigames / content.
- **Stamps**: Used to send "gifts" to your NPC friends, increasing your relationship with them.

Keys and stamps are perhaps more "items" than currencies, but they're earned and spent like a currency! Speaking of currency, it's time to cover why this is an educational game...

The game has amazing financial education built-in! With financial literacy typically being scarily low, especially amongst the younger audience who might play games like this, I was absolutely amazed with how detailed and relevant all the information is. The concepts aren't just mentioned, they are explained in detail, with NPCs offering additional answers to questions. From my first couple of days with the game ("Year 2 Month 2" in-game), I've been exposed to:

1. The **credit rating system**, what it is, why it matters, expressed in-game as "Money Wise Rating". The calculation of this is (as in the real world!) somewhat vague, with an NPC giving you a new score every few months based on your financial behaviour(?).
2. Comparing **current accounts**, with one of the first in-game actions being an explanation of what they are, and choosing between an in-game bank and credit union (which are of course also explained).
3. Comparing **savings accounts**, with an entire quest dedicated to helping find an account that meets an NPC's financial needs, including not needing access for a year, comparing interest rates, etc. The process was essentially identical to real life, providing extremely helpful information to those new to saving money.
4. Comparing **renting vs buying**, a concept that many adults struggle with, is also covered by a quest. Different NPCs offer different pros and cons, just like in the real world, with the ultimate decision being down to you. This is also reinforced by your own need to pay in-game rent, and having to choose where to rent, or try to save up and purchase a house.

This information is also, most importantly, not told in a US-centric way. The advice is generic enough (e.g. using AER %) that it applies to almost any country, reinforced by the developer's self-description:

> Dot Dot Fire creates educational games that empower young people with lifechanging money skills and sustainable lifestyle in 100+ countries.

Whilst I personally didn't learn anything from the game, I already have an intense interest in personal finance (I've reviewed [bank accounts](/chase-bank-uk-review/), made a [house buying & selling calculator](/house-affordability-spreadsheet/), and [shared household expenses strategies](/using-income-ratio-spreadsheet-split-bills/), it's one of my main hobbies!). I also have been comparing bank accounts for 15 years, bought and sold homes, ran startups etc, so I am not the target educational audience. However, for someone a bit younger, or with less of a financial obsession? This game could save them weeks of research, or thousands in wasted financial opportunity.

The developer's other games "[Money Wise Game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DotDotFireLimited.TheNeighborMood)" and "[NeighborMood](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DotDotFire.TheNeighborMoodFP2022)" seem to also be in the genre "fun games that secretly teach you essential financial literacy skills". The screenshots in Money Wise Game in particular highlight avoiding scams, not falling for credit card traps etc, all skills startlingly lacking in the real world.

With Forest Fables succeeding on the gameplay front, the style front, _and_ the educational front, it's one of my strongest recommendations so far. However, will it ruin this with aggressive monetisation? No, it won't!

### Monetisation

Despite having all these currencies, the monetisation is extremely fair! There are no forced adverts, with optional ones available for decent perks like discount vouchers on items.

There are bundles of stamps, gems, keys, ad-free for X days etc, however they are all very cheap. For example, I purchased the largest pack of keys available for just Â£1.49 ($~1.99), and that ensured I could unlock every minigame & area with a couple leftover. Similarly, ad-free for 30 days is often an absurdly overpriced item, here it is just Â£2.49 (~$3.49), so that's an appealing offer too.

Ultimately you don't need any of these at all, with the only real incentive to buy the truly premium currency (gems) optional items like clothes and furniture. I think paying for aesthetic items is totally fine, and a very fair system. This seems to be the developer's intention, as _all_ the more expensive packs are primarily clothing packs (which look great!) with a few gems.

### Tips

- Check your savings account options when your Money Wise Rating increases, as new accounts become available.
- Visit every location every day, and talk to everyone. It increases your friendship status with them slightly.
- I find the croissant cooking game to be the best. All minigames earn the same, but the croissant cooking is easiest to get perfect every time, whilst also being very quick. It also can be played at night, unlike the coffee machine.
- It's probably a bad idea buying items full price, watching an advert for a discount voucher will let you save significantly (25-50%), so should be done whenever possible.
- As with the real world, you should try to keep almost all of your money in a savings account, earning interest.
- Again as with the real world, I personally would recommend saving up for any house to avoid paying rent. Luckily my favourite was the relatively cheap log cabin (12,000), so I'm unlikely to buy any other house leaving plenty of spare money.
- You get paid for your work the month _after_ you work, so don't worry if you don't seem to be earning anything!
