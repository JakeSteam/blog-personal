Idle Iktah is a game with a lot of combat. Quests, game progression, drops for alchemy, all require combat. But... what if you didn't want to fight?

I've been working on a level 3 skiller (1 attack, strength, defence, 10 health), here's a few things I discovered along the way!

## Rules

## Things you cannot do

### Expedition's Echo

### Combat level quests

## How to kill things

Yes, you can kill enemies without gaining any XP!

Admittedly this is only viable if you're doing a "level-based" pacifist run, not if you're trying to avoid killing anything whatsoever. However, here's how you can do it.

### Purple Tome

By using the purple tome, you can (infrequently) deal 100 damage without gaining any XP. This is by far the most reliable way to deal damage.

The problem? This isn't available until combat level 5. Maybe potions can be used to boost and equip the tome?

### Reflect Potion

By reflecting the enemy's damage back at them, you will eventually kill them. However this is slow, and requires a lot of food.

### Cancel attacks

If you have a slower attack speed than the enemy (e.g. 3.0 vs 2.8s), you *can* cancel your attack before it lands, ensuring you'll gain no XP! However, it's pretty hard to do this reliably. Maybe there are some slower weapons to help...

## Priority unlocks & items

### Dugouts

Dugouts let you control traders more, pick which one you get etc. As such, rush carpentry.

### Alchemy pet

Gives you back monster eyes etc rarely whilst making potions, easiest way to get these items

## Conclusion
