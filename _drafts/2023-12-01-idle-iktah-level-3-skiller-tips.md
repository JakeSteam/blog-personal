Idle Iktah is a game with a lot of combat. Quests, game progression, drops for alchemy, all require combat. But... what if you didn't want to fight?

I've been working on a level 3 skiller (1 attack, strength, defence, 10 health), here's a few things I discovered along the way!

## Rules

## Things you cannot do

### Expedition's Echo

### Combat level quests

## How to kill things

Yes, you can kill enemies without gaining any XP!

Admittedly this is only viable if you're doing a "level-based" pacifist run, not if you're trying to avoid killing anything whatsoever. However, here's how you can do it.

### Purple Tome

By using the purple tome, you can (infrequently) deal 100 damage without gaining any XP. This is by far the most reliable way to deal damage.

### Reflect Potion

By reflecting the enemy's damage back at them, you will eventually kill them. However this is slow, and requires a lot of food.

### Traders

## General tips

### Defense is all that matters
