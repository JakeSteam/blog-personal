Okay, so *maybe* Burnout Paradise isn't the hot new racing game, but it *is* an absolute classic with plenty for a game completionist to work through. I recently completed the game after finding it on Xbox Game Pass, here's what I learned.

I had vague memories of playing Burnout Paradise for a few hours years ago. However, I've got a few (hundred...) hours of Forza Horizon and other games under my sleeve now, making this playthrough much easier than last time.

* Make sure to add tips from reddit post (and link it ofc)

## Intro

* Should win every event, usually
* Info on how tips are split up

## Menus

### Right on d-pad to restart event

### Opening the map pauses the game

## Overworld

### End events in dense areas
* For freeroam events, end in city to start a new one instantly

### Drive through all repair shops
* Once discovered, will show up on GPS
* Essential during hunt mode

### Drive through all intersections
* Unlock events to easily access later

### South-east main road is perfect
* Has lots of billboards, big jumps, predictable traffic
* Good for surviving, AND stunt runs.

## Progession

### Reduce downtime
* Just do nearest event

## Driving

### Takedowns are crucial
* Easy boost
* Massive advantage

### A takedown can save you
* If a car is taken down, the cutscene saves you and steers briefly

### Do not crash
* No really, you'll lose SO much time

## Cars

### Drive whatever you want
* No need to win with specific cars to unlock cars
* 

### There is no best car
* Talk about Spur
* A good car can do almost any event

## Game modes
* Briefly describe them 

### Races

#### Fewest turns route is best
* Ideal route is 1-2 straight lines
* Corners are risk
* Having to keep pausing makes you take your eyes off the road

### Marked man

#### Off road long paths are best
* No traffic
* Easy to survive

### Road rage

#### Direction doesn't matter

#### Bully small cars

#### Bump strong cars from behind

#### Stop when target reached

### Stunt

#### Final run is infinitely long

#### Drive to where you know

#### Crashing at the end is fine

## General tips

### Boosts
* Types of boost

### Licenses
* Licenses don't seem to matter
* Full license takes 7-11 hours, with 50 + 17 + 13 + 3 + 7 wins (90)
* Elite full license takes... more, with 110ish more

### Vehicle types
* Bikes, minis, cop cars, etc

## Review

* Music is insufferable, especially when it plays full volume during initial loading screen, whilst cars load in, etc
