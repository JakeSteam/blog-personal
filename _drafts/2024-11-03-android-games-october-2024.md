intro

## #1: [IdleTale](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.EdGrace.Idle)

IdleTale is an autofighter incremental, with perhaps the best drip-feeding of content I've ever seen in a game.

### Review

At least 5-6 times so far during my time with IdleTale, I've been sure I'm _about_ to reach the end of the early access content. And yet, every time, a new mechanic, area, upgrade, or complexity appears _just in time_ to keep me hooked!

As a heads-up, this game is [also available (for free) on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3196540/IdleTale/), with a more detailed description than the Play Store. This review will also have spoilers of my experience so far.

The core gameplay is extremely simple. Automatically run right, tap to attack enemy (later upgrades automate this, or let you just hold down instead of tap). Enemies drop gold (and XP later), that can be used to upgrade your skills, buy upgrades, upgrade enemies, etc. However, this simple basic game quickly evolves...

My screenshots later on in this post will probably seem unrelated to the game you initially download. Those 6 buttons at the bottom? All appear through progress. The dungeon & map selector on the right? Appears through progress. Glory, energy, 2x coin boost, selecting character? Through progress! In fact, ignoring the 4 simple "Skills" upgrades (e.g. Wisdom, which boosts crit damage & attack power), there are 6 upgrade paths I've found _so far_:

1. Level-up upgrades: Two skill trees, drastic upgrades with multiple levels and unique features. Can pay a small fee to respec at any time.
2. Shop upgrades: More linear, used to unlock new areas, stat boosts, etc.
3. "Gains" upgrades: Typical basic incremental upgrades, just used for increasing passive income (although purchasing these can unlock shop upgrades).
4. Codex upgrades: Expensive, but boosts the XP & GP dropped by enemies in an area.
5. Glory upgrades: Prestige upgrades, very hard to earn points but unlock significant new content (e.g. character switcher) much later in the game.
6. Gear upgrades: Typically earned from grinding boss dungeons, there's no way to upgrade gear but hunting high level equipment is very rewarding.

I've no doubt whatsoever that there's far more to unlock even after my 10-15 hours, e.g. on my next prestige I'm going to buy "Bad Luck Aura", which unlocks "Bad Luck Shop and the Lucky Coins". What does this do? No idea, but it makes me want to unlock it to find out!

There's excellent artwork throughout, with at least 10 challenge dungeons (with unique bosses and settings) and 10 maps (automatic fighting), all featuring fully animated enemies. This is lucky, since you'll be grinding maps quite a lot, so appealing visuals help.

The game does a good job of balancing various currencies and traits, since you'll need to choose level-up perks and equipment based on your playstyle, whilst also considering dodge chance, attack speed, crit chance, multi-hit chance, glory gains, elemental resistance, haunted weapon spawning, and more.

Whilst this might make the game seem chaotic and confusing, the slow release of features ensures you're never overwhelmed, and instead constantly have a couple of goals to work towards.

Extremely engrossing and absorbing, I'm terrified if I'll ever escape playing this game!

### Monetisation

There's none. At all. Anywhere. I have absolutely no idea how this has been made free so far, with the Steam page showcasing the staggering amount of free content available:

> **What is the current state of the Early Access version?**
>
> “As of now, IdleTale offers over several weeks of content, featuring over 400 items to collect, over 250 achievements to unlock, 50 total levels, over 30 different dungeons (counting Normal and Deadly modes) and a lot of enemies and maps to discover!”
>
> **Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?**
>
> “IdleTale will remain free after launch.”

I presume in-app purchases will appear eventually, but there's nothing yet.

### Tips

- Shop upgrades are often unlocked after purchasing X (e.g. 10, 25, 50, 100) of the simple idle cash generators (e.g. health potions), so try to purchase in batches.
- I tried to balance my idle income and active income, e.g. ensuring my "Gains" were upgraded as much as my "Skills" / "Codex". Of course shop upgrades affect this, but it's something to aim for!
- You can likely do dungeons earlier than you think, when you're at or just before the minimum level. However, there's no point doing them until you can use the reward weapons (tap them on dungeon preview for minimum level).
- When prestiging, be clear what glory upgrade you're aiming for. Once you're earning glory it's pretty easy to gain a few more, so push further if you can wait.
- Respeccing your level up perks is quite cheap, so if you've hit a wall it's worth trying. I found the "assassination" path to be better for damage & boss fights.
- I did my first prestige around level 33, and my second around 35, with my third at 38. This felt late enough, and may have even been a bit early, since rebuilding after a prestige takes significant effort.
- Whilst you can store & withdraw items from the armoury across playthroughs based on your level, you'll likely only be doing this manually for a single run so it's not worth worrying about much. There's an "autogear" button unlocked via prestige later.
- There's [a discord server](https://discord.com/invite/B9mamWkNtV) with a startling 3700 members, I haven't joined yet though as I'm enjoying the discovery process. I'll likely give it a look once I've hit a "wall" I can't find a way past.
