## Pocket Quest: Merge RPG ([Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.funovus.pocket.quest))

Even as someone who has never played or watched a second of the popular Loop Hero, I'm pretty sure Pocket Quest is *heavily* inspired. Your hero runs loops around the map, battling enemies and gaining loot. You place terrain on the map between loops, and upgrade your hero's gear and attributes.

I had a great couple of days with the game, and it's a real shame it's not longer.

### Review 

I found the strategy just keep enough for a mobile game, and eventually figured out a few traits that felt overpowered, and managed to push through the game pretty quickly. It has all the energy timer / equipment upgrade / coin buying / diamond microtransactions you'd expected, but... they forgot to make enough content!

There's only 6 themes / maps, and once you've progressed through them all there's nothing else. No endless mode, no challenges, no competitions, not even a congratulations screen. The equipment system seems... far too in depth for the length of the game. I didn't see half the items, only upgraded a couple of things, and didn't really interact with my equipment much.

Despite this, I had a really enjoyable couple of days with the game. It's free, and worth playing, but don't expect more than a few hours of fun!

### Monetisation 
The energy recharged fast enough to not be much of an issue, adverts were always optional, and no microtransactions were worth buying. I would have happily paid for an XP doubling one-off payment or similar, but none was available. 

I did watch a few ads to resurrect at the end of a failed run, luckily as this is only possible once per run (and resurrects your hero with 50% health) it isn't overpowered.

### Tips
I found a few traits during runs to be extremely helpful:

1. Heal on damage 
2. Heal on kill
3. Wolf companion

These 3 combined meant you could place a treasure chest down, and get a decent chunk of guaranteed healing from it. Additionally, your wolf (which respawns within a hit or two) tanks a lot of hits for you, and can be upgraded to 2 wolves later on.
