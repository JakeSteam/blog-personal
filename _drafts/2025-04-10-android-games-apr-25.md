## #1: [Ore Buster](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tornupgaming.orebuster)

I spotted this short but sweet incremental in the ever-reliable [r/incremental_games "What games are you playing" thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/incremental_games/comments/1j7r4qf/what_games_are_you_playing_this_week_game/mh2hv0j/). It only took a couple of hours to complete, so it's worth your time!

### Screenshots

All screenshots are from version 1.0.5:

### Review

One of the simplest concepts I've seen in an incremental, your little guy mines rocks, you swipe / tap to collect the ores mined. Eventually he runs out of stamina, and you use the ores to buy upgrades and play again. That's the entire thing!

Later on in the game you'll unlock a chance to spawn gold rocks, plus a "mythical" rock that unlocks the next difficulty. Unfortunately each of these difficulties is visually identical, with the only changes being higher stamina drain and rock strength, but higher ore value. This means there's no reason to ever play a difficulty beyond the highest you can survive at.

Collecting the ores is much easier than I initially suspected, with a vague swiping over the screen collecting a large area. You have no control over your character whatsoever, so calmly collecting dropped ores is as active as it gets!

So if the game is just the same grassy field over and over, what's the appeal? The upgrades! They're all pretty affordable, with a few upgrades being purchasable after every short run. These vary from fairly boring move speed or pickaxe strength up to stamina regeneration, rock igniting, lightning, automatic resource collecting, etc, and make each run feel a little bit different.

This rapid progress is great for making an enjoyable game, but unfortunately means you'll reach the end pretty quickly and unceremoniously! It's a real shame that the steady pace of new content and improvement wasn't sustained into some sort of new areas, or additional complexity, since there's no replay value in a linear upgrade tree. For example, you'll quickly unlock gold and then... no other ore ever.

### Monetisation

There's incentivised adverts, each of which give a pretty generous 20 minutes of double ore. There are also cheap in-app purchases (Â£1.19 / ~$1.50) for double strength or stamina, a speed boost, etc. I purchased a speed boost.

### Tips

- Stamina is what ends your run, so upgrades like stamina regeneration or stamina on rock destroy are extremely important.
- If your runs are ending within a few seconds, lower the difficulty and you'll earn far more.
- Destroying mythical rocks only happens a few times, so shouldn't be prioritised for upgrades.

## #2: [Idle Space Force](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.FuseGamesLLC.IdleSpaceForce)

Another r/incremental_games find, posted [by the developer](https://www.reddit.com/r/incremental_games/comments/1j88ky1/idle_space_force_new_level_upgrades_dinosaur_pet/)! Idle Space Force is a fairly simple but satisfying incremental across multiple planets.

### Screenshots

All screenshots are from version 12.2.2:

### Review

This is one of those games where you'll "get" it within 5 minutes, and will know whether you enjoy the gameplay loop or not!

You'll spend your time gathering fuel in space, then travelling to various planets and collecting other exclusive resources to purchase upgrades (and eventually upgrade fuel capacity to get to the next planet). This is done by shooting enemies on a vertically scrolling screen, with persistent upgrades unlocking idle money, passive attacks, etc.

As with many incremental games, it's impossible to "fail" at any point. Instead, you just need to wait for your fuel (or other collectible) quantity to hit the necessary amount, then you'll be able to progress. It is very linear, with almost no strategy, beyond identifying if any upgrades are close to the 25/50/75/100 milestones that unlock a 2x purchase.

Progress is fairly quick initially, but slows down around the planet "Petra". Unfortunately there's little active gameplay here, with the only viable approach leaving the game open for a couple of days to collect enough "fossils".

Active gameplay is possible, but after a few weapon upgrades slowly swiping left to right will provide identical results to anything more challenging, and is only slightly better than letting your passive weapons work.

There are a few extra bits that are worth calling out. You'll have daily quests (just defeat X, play for X seconds, kill X extra large monsters) providing star coins or temporary boosts, and a standard daily item bonus. This is likely where my first pet will come from, with "Panda" unlocked after Day 15. There's also a "boost" feature which provides a slight increase in enemy rate for a very brief period.

Overall there's a satisfying gameplay loop, but the gameplay can feel a little thin after a couple of planets. Whilst I'm only on the Dune-themed planet 4 (of 6), and there seems to be a prestige mechanic later on, I suspect I won't make it that far. However, it's a pretty fun first few hours, and worth a go!

### Monetisation

There are a few monetisation methods, luckily all of them are optional (and none feel too overpowered).

Primarily there's the ability to watch an advert for instant cash (or 2x boost), but this is typically a fairly small amount and not worth doing. Additionally, there's the usual ad-free purchase (a bit too expensive for me, at Â£6.49 (~$8.50)), and a premium "star coins" currency used for permanent boosts.

These star coins can be earned slowly through normal gameplay (this is good!), and used to permanently double item drops or boost cash gain, unlock pets, access cosmetics, temporarily boost loot, etc. Interestingly, there's even a [Patreon link](https://www.patreon.com/IdleSpaceForce), with $5/mo unlocking unique cosmetics.

Whilst I do appreciate how the monetisation is entirely optional, I'm not a fan of the loot chests that can be purchased, and the premium currency is fairly expensive. For context, I'm a few days in and have around 90 star coins (100 is Â£2 (~$3)), so will shortly be able to buy a chest (5-20% chance at a pet), a purely cosmetic theme, or a temporary boost.

### Tips

- Generators have 2x purchases unlocked at 25/50/75/100, so it's worth getting to those milestones if possible.
- Each new generator is usually far more valuable than the one before, make sure to focus them.
- Progress is pretty linear, so not many tips are needed!
