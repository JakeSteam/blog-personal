## #1: [Ore Buster](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tornupgaming.orebuster)

I spotted this short but sweet incremental in the ever-reliable [r/incremental_games "What games are you playing" thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/incremental_games/comments/1j7r4qf/what_games_are_you_playing_this_week_game/mh2hv0j/). It only took a couple of hours to complete, so it's worth your time!

### Screenshots

All screenshots are from version 1.0.5:

### Review

One of the simplest concepts I've seen in an incremental, your little guy mines rocks, you swipe / tap to collect the ores mined. Eventually he runs out of stamina, and you use the ores to buy upgrades and play again. That's the entire thing!

Later on in the game you'll unlock a chance to spawn gold rocks, plus a "mythical" rock that unlocks the next difficulty. Unfortunately each of these difficulties is visually identical, with the only changes being higher stamina drain and rock strength, but higher ore value. This means there's no reason to ever play a difficulty beyond the highest you can survive at.

Collecting the ores is much easier than I initially suspected, with a vague swiping over the screen collecting a large area. You have no control over your character whatsoever, so calmly collecting dropped ores is as active as it gets!

So if the game is just the same grassy field over and over, what's the appeal? The upgrades! They're all pretty affordable, with a few upgrades being purchasable after every short run. These vary from fairly boring move speed or pickaxe strength up to stamina regeneration, rock igniting, lightning, automatic resource collecting, etc, and make each run feel a little bit different.

This rapid progress is great for making an enjoyable game, but unfortunately means you'll reach the end pretty quickly and unceremoniously! It's a real shame that the steady pace of new content and improvement wasn't sustained into some sort of new areas, or additional complexity, since there's no replay value in a linear upgrade tree. For example, you'll quickly unlock gold and then... no other ore ever.

### Monetisation

There's incentivised adverts, each of which give a pretty generous 20 minutes of double ore. There are also cheap in-app purchases (Â£1.19 / ~$1.50) for double strength or stamina, a speed boost, etc. I purchased a speed boost.

### Tips

- Stamina is what ends your run, so upgrades like stamina regeneration or stamina on rock destroy are extremely important.
- If your runs are ending within a few seconds, lower the difficulty and you'll earn far more.
- Destroying mythical rocks only happens a few times, so shouldn't be prioritised for upgrades.
