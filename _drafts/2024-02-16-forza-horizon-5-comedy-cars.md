Forza Horizon 5 has a lot of cars: over 800 by now. Whilst most of these are very sensible, some are more useful for driving backwards, wheelies, or just looking very silly!

Whilst humour is subjective, I'm British so unsurprisingly enjoy a bit of slapstick, a bit of absurdist, and a [bit of shitshow comedy](/the-irresistible-allure-of-shitshow-comedy/). Luckily, Forza can offer all of these if you look hard enough, and combining a stupid car, livery, outfit, and horn can make you the laughingstock of a race. Perfect.

## Cars

### Small cars

The tiny cars are a Forza classic comedy car, and their handling is usually so chaotic that they're only really usable in Playground Games events. They become bizarrely competitive in this context, since they have great acceleration and are tricky to hunt down.

**1962 Peel P50**

Awful at high speeds, but can turn on a dime, the P50 is very bouncy and has _so_ many custom liveries. Mine is Thomas the Tank Engine.

**1965 Peel Trident**

A bit smoother to drive the P50, and looks like a spaceship regardless of livery. Mine is a tasty burger.

**1957 BMW Isetta 300 Export**

The mildest of the small silly cars, the Isetta is actually pretty driveable! Mine is S1 class, with a beautiful golden livery.

### Big cars

There is something very satisfying about racing using a car twice the size of everyone else, and _winning_. Hopefully the others find the massive vehicles as entertaining!

**2015 Mercedes-Benz Tankpool24**

I love the Tankpool truck, since it provides lots of space for a livery, is very visible, can nudge any other car aside, yet still has decent performance. Oh, and [truck racing is a real thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnHWL-J-3KE)!

**2014 Mercedes-Benz Unimog**

### Hot Wheels cars

Most of the Hot Wheels cars look a little odd, but these 4 are completely ridiculous.

**2000 Deora 2**

Electric cars just as fast backwards, since it's just the 1st gear

**1958 Austin-Healey Sprite Mk1**
