Forza Horizon 5 has a lot of cars: over 800 by now. Whilst most of these are very sensible, competitive cars... there's a few that are only useful for entertaining others. They're very silly.

## Small cars

The tiny cars are a Forza classic, and their handling is usually so chaotic that they're only really usable in Playground Games events. They become bizarrely competitive in this context, since they have great acceleration and are tricky to hunt down.

### 1962 Peel P50

### 1965 Peel Trident

### ???? BMW Isetta 300 Export

## Big cars

There is something very satisfying about racing using a car twice the size of everyone else, and _winning_. Hopefully the others find it the massive vehicles as entertaining!

### Tankpool #24

I love the Tankpool truck, since it provides lots of space for a livery, is very visible, can nudge any other car aside, yet still has decent performance. Oh, and [truck racing is a real thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnHWL-J-3KE)!

### Unimog

## Hot Wheels cars

### 2000 Deora 2

### 2012 Bad To The Blade
