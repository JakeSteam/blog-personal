Forza Horizon 5 is easily my favourite game of 2021/22, and it contains a comprehensive "accolade" (achievements) system. Earning these accolades improves your global hall of fame ranking, as well as various rewards along the way. However, the Creative category contains many accolades that are seemingly impossible to complete. Here's how I got them, since I couldn't find any guides! 

In this post I'll show my current accolades to "prove" the methods in here work, then break down exactly how to get them. This will start off simple, with the obvious ones, before ramping up to the far harder ones that require grinding (e.g. 1000 tune uses).

This is a **LONG** post, so use the links on the side to get to the section you need or search for your target accolade's name!

## My creative accolades

To start with, here's my current global ranking & creative accolades to prove I at least vaguely know what I'm talking about! Essentially they're all complete besides 6 glitched painting accolades, and 2 tuning accolades that will take a few more nights of idling.

| #87 out of 21m+ players | Painting (38/44) | Tuning (25/27) |

## Achieving simple accolades

### Painting

The painting accolades *"Respray", "By popular request", "Hoods up", "They look like ears", "Spoilers", "Keeping it wheel", "Optional extra",* and *"Attention to detail"* all just require painting every part of a vehicle, very simple.

### Tuning

The tuning accolades *"The upgrader", "The ultra upgrader", "The tuner",* and *"The ultra tuner"* just require winning events with tunes and upgrades applied, and will probably be completed during normal gameplay.

The accolades *"All expenses paid", "Performance interest", "Picking up the tab", "Worth it",* and *"To the zoom"* require spending up to 2m credits on upgrades, which will likely happen during normal gameplay.

### Photo

The photo accolades *"Say cheese", "Snap!", "Photo op", "Says 1000 words", "Fit to print", "Picture perfect", "You're on camera", "Car-tography", "Photoshoot", "Capture this", "Camera fiend", "Visionary", "#nofilter", "Perfect shot", "Snap happy", "Paparazzi", "Ridiculously photogenic", "Seeing the big picture", "Promo-tion", "Shutterbug", "Strike a pose", "Poster cars",* and *"Promo superstar"* require taking photos of up to 500 different cars.

This is easiest to do during normal gameplay by taking a quick photo (you don't need to save it) at the start of each race or when you see players online. Cars that you haven't captured yet have a camera icon above their vehicle.

If you do need to do hundreds of cars quickly, the quickest way I've found is starting drag races with various cars, taking a photo of the 8-10 AI cars, then quitting and trying again with another car.

The accolades *"New horizons", "New digs!", "Sleeping giant", "Twilight saga", "Shopping spree", "On the naughty list", "Spirit of a christmas past", "Stay frosty", "Crowd pleaser", "Coraz√≥n contento", "Synth waves", "Cleared for takeoff", "Peak performance", "And the crowd goes wild", "Firework display", "Photogenic", "Chips to my salsa", "Beam me up", "No rest for the wicked", "Flash in the pan", "Throwback", "Look out, beetle's about",* and *"Porsche with panache" are all very straightforward, and require taking photos of specific cars in specific places.

### Eventlab

The eventlab accolades *"Pathfinder", "Show me your moves", "Creative spark", "Mix and match", "Architect of fun", "Variety pack", "Master builder", "Lucky dip", "Empire of imagination", "Like a box of chocolates", "Compendium of creation", "Content surfing", "Intrepid explorer",* and *"Hero of the community"* are all very simple, just requiring basic creation & playing of eventlab tracks.

The accolades "_ class blueprint badge" for every car class can be done on the same event so long as it accepts any car class. 

### Super7

The super7 accolades *"The super7", "Three of a kind", "Lucky for some", "A worthy opponent", "Smile for the camera", "Danger is my middle name", "Drift like me", "The journey", "Driving skills", "Scoring skills", "Mastering skills",* and *"Third party coverage",* are all easily completable, and will likely all be completed whilst working on completing 7x super 7.

*"A wild challenge card appears!", "Card hunter",* and *"Card collector"* require completing cards in freeroam, I find the best place to find these is on the airport runway drag strip or the main Horizon festival drag strip.
