## #1: [Word Salad](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wordsalad.app)

I'm a sucker for a new word game idea, and Word Salad is this month's!

### Review

The gameplay is very similar to The New York Times' "[Strands](https://www.nytimes.com/games/strands)" game, where the goal is to use up all the letters in a grid to form words. Unlike Strands, in Word Salad you'll be told the level's theme, as well as the length of all words in the grid.

The puzzles always feel fair, and solvable, with your own ability to think of appropriate words the only limiting factor! For example, a puzzle theme of "Shades of Blue" might take a few minutes to solve, whereas "Planets" can be done in under a minute.

Navigating around the game can be a little confusing, as there's no "home" screen as such. Instead, you're always in a puzzle, and can open an overlay menu to change settings or pick a new level. Completing a puzzle prompts you to play the next puzzle, so this isn't much of an issue in practice.

There's a "Selfie mode" which... seems to involve using your front facing camera and microphone to solve puzzles somehow!? I only opened this up to get the achievements, there's no requirement (nor interest from my side). I couldn't find a tutorial for this so... it's a mystery.

The game has quite a few unique additions like this, clearly showing the developers (Bleppo Games, Mark and Samuel) have creative freedom. For example, some puzzles have a recoloured "selection" line, such as European countries being yellow and blue (Ukraine).

Whilst you can "cheat" and get hints, these hints only provide a letter at a time, so are essentially a way to steer you in the right direction rather than outright solve. These can be purchased in packs, or a single advert watch gives a reasonable 5 hints.

In terms of level selection, you've got a daily puzzle (80 at time of writing), and all past puzzles can be completed too. Additionally, there are 300 free puzzles grouped into 3 categories, and 3 paid packs totalling 1000 puzzles, also grouped into 4-8 categories. I'll cover monetisation in the next section, but considering each puzzle will take 1-5 minutes having almost 400 for free is a pretty good deal!

### Monetisation

Monetisation seems pretty reasonable, with 4 techniques being used depending on your budget:

1. Short 5-second adverts between every couple of solved levels.
2. A $3-4 purchase to remove these intermission adverts.
3. Hints obtained from watching an advert (gives 5), or in packs (25 for $1).
4. Ad-free content packs, e.g. 500 "Natural World" puzzles, grouped into Mammals, Birds, etc, for $5-6.

Whilst having 4 approaches might seem like aggressive monetising, I definitely don't see it that way. Instead, I see it as the core part of the game being free (with occasional adverts), and the ability to purchase complete DLCs. The hints absolutely aren't required.

I suspect I'll work my way through the free content, watching the occasional advert for hints then purchase 1 or 2 of the content packs. Credit has to be given for the actual gameplay not including any banner adverts, a distraction that often ruins logic games for me.

### Tips

- Since words can loop back on themselves, I find it helpful to look for words that are "roughly" correct, then try to figure out the path. Otherwise, you might accidentally mentally block off a letter you need next.
- Focus on unique letters. If you have a J or a Z, what words include those somewhere?
- Diagonally isolated letters are powerful. If you have a letter only connected by a diagonal, it must be the start or end of a word.
- I find it helpful to look away from the board sometimes, and just try to come up with answers, then see which will fit.
- The game is US-centric, so terms like "Recess" will be used. This doesn't happen too often after the unfortunate "US states" tutorial puzzle!

### Suggestions

- I'd love a dark mode, the bright white screen makes it hard to play at night!
- The ability to hide the timer would be appreciated, the time doesn't matter (except for a few achievements) so it's unnecessary.
- Seeing an overall game complete % would be great, e.g. "20% current pack, 4% total", and a motivator to complete all the DLCs.
- Whilst I'm comfortable paying the small price for additional packs, others might be unable to (e.g. sanctioned countries, no digital payment methods, kids), so an alternate method of unlock might be useful. For example, a full length advert per level.
- A user-submitted (free) pack would be great! Obviously there'd need to be a way to gather submissions.
