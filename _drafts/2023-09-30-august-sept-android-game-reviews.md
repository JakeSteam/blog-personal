I've barely played anything recently besides my beloved Slitherlink! Despite this, I did find a couple of new underrated little Android games.

The games are in descending order of "fun", and might contain mild spoilers:

## #1: [Inventory Idle](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.extedcoud.invntoryidle)

Inventory Idle is technically unreleased, I saw [this open beta announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/incremental_games/comments/16095fc/inventory_idle/) and couldn't resist since I love... inventories! The game may have changed by the time this article comes out, I played v1.0.6.

### Review

The core gameplay loop here is really, really satisfying: Make a good weapon, use the blueprint of it to increase your income, use this income to improve weapon generation, and repeat.

The complexity comes from the number of ways income can be increased, including:
1. Buying level-ups and using the skill points to improve weapon value, magic upgrades, weapon quality, weapon luck, and the speed to create a weapon.
2. Buying improvements to weapon generators, so they produce more items at once.
3. Buying magic upgrades (unlocked by quest completions) that usually give free weapon generators.
4. Finally, there's also a prestige mechanic that... is perhaps a little bit overcomplicated and hard to parse, yet doesn't seem particularly worth it.

You can have up to 10 "plants" producing your blueprints, with each being completely independent. During the early game figuring out which tier of items are most profitable can be tricky, since you can usually produce *more* of the common items, yet they are worth less.

Luckily, the plant overview actually shows the money per second in addition to the item cost, so this can be compared easily. Whilst this gameplay loop and the variety of ways to increase income ensure the first few hours are engaging, it dries up a bit after that. Prestiging doesn't seem very powerful, as it takes an extremely long time to get back to where you were for relatively minor benefits.

The game suffered from a few unintuitive design choices, such as a dedicated "inventory" screen on the navigation bar despite the only purpose being to delete unused blueprints. This would be OK if there were limited features, but essential screens like plant upgrades, quests, and prestiging are hidden away! 

There were a few minor bugs (as to be expected with a beta!), mostly around audio not muting properly and numbers below 100 not displaying properly. However, the actual gameplay seems smooth, albeit a bit aimless later on. Late game (Level 400 after a couple of prestiges) is unfortunately extremely repetitive. All you'll do is tap generate weapon once a second, *very* rarely (< 1/200) change your blueprints, then occasionally buy minor upgrades. 

Despite some of these negative comments, the polish around weapon generation really shows, and it hooks into the "lootbox" part of your brain. I actually played much longer than I expected to due to how satisfying the weapon creation feels. The game has massive potential, but needs better longer term rewards (e.g. a "collection log" of items).

### Monetisation

There are only optional adverts. Watching one spins a wheel with pretty underwhelming rewards such as 2 million coins when I earned 30 million coins in idle income whilst watching the advert. Another common reward was 10 diamonds, with the cheapest reward (just some coins) being 100 diamonds. Due to this, I only tried the wheel 3-4x.

I'd have liked to see the ability to purchase income multipliers, improved luck, or longer idle income, let me pay to speed up progress!

### Tips

* Don't prestige early. The game will give you access far before you should do it, I'd recommend waiting until you're into the billions.
* Prices scale up quickly in the early game, so you'll be replacing weapons pretty often.
* Higher quality items won't necessarily earn more. In the long run they will, but if you have more plant upgrades for a lower quality it might be a better choice.
* "Production" is king. If this number is higher, use that blueprint. There is no reason to try and use all the same quality or anything like that, all that matters is income.
