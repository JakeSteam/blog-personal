As must be obvious by now from the [many](/current-book-collection-and-organisation/) [book-related](/analysing-5-years-of-amazon-kindle-reading/) [posts](/analysing-my-goodreads-book-history/), I love reading. After using my beloved Paperwhite 3 for 30-60m a day, I decided it was time to treat myself to an upgrade. Before I give the still very capable older Kindle away, here's a visual comparison!  

## Visual comparison (to book)

| Scenario | Comparison | Notes |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Size comparison | [![](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-book-thumbnail.jpg)](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-book.jpg) | I've used 2 Penguin classics as "relatable" sizes. Essentially the Paperwhite 5 is slightly smaller than a typical paperback book, and the same size as the older, small paperbacks. |
| Paperwhite 3 | [![](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-book-pw3-thumbnail.jpg)](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-book-pw3.jpg) | As shown, you can fit 60-70% of a typical paperback page onto a Paperwhite 3 (font size 2, small margins, medium spacing) |
| Paperwhite 5 | [![](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-book-pw5-thumbnail.jpg)](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-book-pw5.jpg) | However with a Paperwhite 5 you can fit roughly a whole page on the screen at once (font size 2, small margins, medium spacing)! |

## Visual comparison (without case)

| Scenario | Comparison | Notes |
| -- | -- | -- |
| From bottom | [![](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-nocase-bottom-thumbnail.jpg)](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-nocase-bottom.jpg) | They're pretty much identical from the bottom, although the Paperwhite 3 does have that odd "bump" whilst the Paperwhite 5 is a smooth surface. |
| From back | [![](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-nocase-back-thumbnail.jpg)](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-nocase-back.jpg) | Farewell, Amazon logo! The minimalistic arrow is a small, but nice change. |
| Screen (no warmth) | [![](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-screen-nowarmth-thumbnail.jpg)](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-screen-nowarmth.jpg) | The difference in screen tone isn't as noticeable in person! The Paperwhite 3's screen looks similar to Paperwhite 5's warmth level 1-2. |
| Screen (my preferred warmth) | [![](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-screen-normal-thumbnail.jpg)](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-screen-normal.jpg) | I read at warmth level 3, to me it looks like a brand new paperback book. |
| Screen (max warmth) | [![](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-screen-fullwarmth-thumbnail.jpg)](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-screen-fullwarmth.jpg) | Surely reading like this is impossible! However, here's the maximum warmth just for comparison. |

## Visual comparison (with case)

For my Paperwhite 3 I've got a pretty standard [FINTIE case](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00JPB83T0/), whilst my [Paperwhite 5 Kids](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/kindle-paperwhite-kids-includes-over-a-thousand-books-a-child-friendly-cover-and-a-2-year-worry-free-guarantee-robot-dreams/dp/B08WPJMC44/) came with a free black case.

| Scenario | Comparison | Notes |
| -- | -- | -- |
| From bottom | [![](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-case-bottom-thumbnail.jpg)](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-case-bottom.jpg) | The official Amazon case is a bit bulkier when open, but feels sturdier. |
| Side by side | [![](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-case-sidebyside-thumbnail.jpg)](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-case-sidebyside.jpg) | No real differences from this angle, besides the obvious screen size. |
| Side by side (with case open) | [![](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-case-sidebyside2-thumbnail.jpg)](/assets/images/2022/paperwhite-case-sidebyside2.jpg) | Not a very fair comparison since my Paperwhite 3's case has had years of use! Unsurprisingly they're pretty similar, although it is nice having a magnetised cover without requiring a little "ridge". |

## Battery

After using the Paperwhite 5 for a few weeks, the battery life felt slightly better. However, since the battery had only dropped by 30-40% in this time, it's hard to tell!

A very unofficial test was conducted by:

1. Setting brightness to maximum.
2. Turn on Wi-Fi.
3. Leaving the screen on the library.
4. Swiping to change page once every 2 minutes (to avoid screen timeout).
5. Waiting for the battery to drop 1%.

| Device | Time |
| -- | -- |
| Paperwhite 3 | 8m 59s |
| Paperwhite 5 | 13m 46s |

Pretty conclusive results! Of course, whilst the Paperwhite 5's battery is better, I suspect a lot of this battery life difference is down to just being a brand new battery. Still, it's good to see the larger screen, more RAM, and more LEDs aren't having a noticeable impact on battery.

There's also a "Power Saver" mode that was on by default on my new device, and I've left on. It means the screen takes 2-3 seconds to turn on, but seems to make no actual difference in usage. Given any Paperwhite lasts multiple weeks of usage anyway (Amazon ), the power saver mode probably isn't necessary!
