## #1: [Pinball Masters](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.NGP.ZenPinball)

Do you remember playing [Space Cadet Pinball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Tilt!_Pinball#3D_Pinball_for_Windows_%E2%80%93_Space_Cadet) as a kid? Well, Pinball Masters is more of that, albeit with more varied themes! It's a Netflix game, so it's all free if you have a Netflix subscription.

### Review

First things first, I'm no good at pinball. I can do _okay_, but the ball often just... goes into places the flippers can't reach. Such is life. Regardless, Pinball Masters lets me have a bit of fun before this inevitably happens 3x and the game is over.

Pinball is, like a lot of games with simple control schemes, something that will always work far better with physical feedback. Failing that, the simple "tap left for left flipper, right for right flipper" control scheme works as well as can be expected on a touchscreen.

There are 7 tables included, covering concepts like Eldritch Horrors, Godzilla, Pacific Rim, and more. How can Godzilla be made into a pinball game you might wonder? Well, it can't really. The tables are unsurprisingly all quite similar gameplay wise, albeit with different layouts and "quests" / "bonuses" appropriate for their theme.

For example, "Pinball Noir" (my favourite) has a revolver barrel in the middle of the board that can be spun and filled with "bullets" (balls), starting various quests and missions.

That doesn't mean that the tables feel lazy or poorly implemented, however. They're all as high quality as possible, featuring their own unique mechanics and minigames. The inclusion of 9 camera angles is a nice feature, although they're all vaguely similar. Perhaps a pinball fanatic can advise on why one is better!

As a reward for completing each of the 3 score objectives on each table, new cosmetics will be unlocked. Although these are mostly pointless, they do show up on the global leaderboard which may be an incentive for some.

### Monetisation

As a Netflix game (see [previous post](/_posts/2024-07-19-android-games-netflix.md)) it's completely free if you have a Netflix subscription, with no adverts or ability to pay for anything.

### Tips

It's just pinball!

Try and aim the ball wherever various flashing arrows point, and try firing the ball from different parts of the paddle to see where it goes.
