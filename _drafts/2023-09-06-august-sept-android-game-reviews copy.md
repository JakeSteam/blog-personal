## Update on previous games

I'm trying something new with this post, and giving a little conclusion on whether I'm still enjoying [games from my previous post](/august-sept-android-game-reviews/), since longevity is important!

### Casting Away

**Uninstalled at level 23.**

This got too grindy in the late game. Whilst earning money and experience was very easy using the techniques mentioned in my post, it's all a bit pointless. Realistically each run is identical, and there are no surprises after 4-5 hours of gameplay.

### Inventory Idle

**Uninstalled at around 20B/sec.**

I knew this didn't have longevity (as it was a beta), and uninstalled it before writing the previous post. Unfortunately there just wasn't wnough depth to make it a long term game.

### Griddie Islands

**Uninstalled at level 37, 5.55T/s.**

Whilst I enjoyed the tetris gimmick, that's all the game really has to offer. I didn't see *any* new features since around level 10, and no sign of the "level loop" hinted at in the achievements. Additionally, it had annoyances like popping all my achievements again when opened, unexpectedly playing music, intermittent ad availability, etc.

### Fill-a-pix

**Uninstalled with first 2-3 packs completed.**

This was a real shame. As mentioned in my review, whilst I enjoy the gameplay the sheer quantity of purchasable level packs makes it unappealing. Additionally, there's no... point to completing them. 

I discovered the great "assistant" feature after my last review, which helps find errors & shows you the logic behind your next move. This helped me play it longer than the other games reviewed, but was not quite enough.
