intro

The games are in descending order of "fun", and might contain mild spoilers:

## #1: [King's Landing](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Creauctopus.KingsLanding)

King's Landing - Idle Arcade was not what I expected. It looked like one of those typical "waiting simulator" incremental games, and I was fully expecting grindy gameplay with constant adverts. It was far better than that!

### Review

King's Landing is clearly early in development from an indie developer, yet has a satisfying core gameplay loop. Collect resources, process them, use them to unlock new areas, buildings, and automation.

There's only a couple of hours of gameplay here, and there's no offline progress. The almost entirely active gameplay will consist solely of walking between buildings that produce resources and areas than require them. New areas and content unlocks frequently, which stops the small number of game items (7-8 in total) becoming too tiring to farm.

Resources can be gathered by employees, and later on this is the only reasonable way to get the large quantities of items required. Essentially you'll primarily be ferrying raw materials from the storage units to processing plants, whilst your employees gather the raw materials.

There's an upgrade system providing a use for coins, but I'd have liked to see it expanded beyond basic "Stone storage stores more" or "Forge processes more at once".

I tried finding out more about the developer, but was left a little confused. There's plenty of games published, but they seem to be unrelated games, with completely different visual styles, descriptions, monetisation, etc. I wondered if "Creauctopus" is some sort of publisher..? [Their website](https://creauctopus.com/) seems to be a solo developer / artist's outdated portfolio, and the developer's bio on linked sites supports this. An impressive range of talent if this really is all from one person!

### Monetisation

There's none! No adverts, no purchases!

### Tips

- Player speed doesn't seem to have much impact, it doesn't seem worth it.
- Selling processed resources is far more profitable than raw.
- Try and keep all processing centres (forge, sawmill, etc) busy at all times, since you'll need a lot of these processed resources.
- Make sure your houses (coin generators) are never full, or they'll stop producing.
- Move items in bulk. There's no point moving a few stones, instead move as many at once as the processing plants can handle. You can then cycle through restocking, maximising efficiency.

## #2: [Tile Collector](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.staplegames.tilecollector)

Tile Collector is a single player version of Mahjong, requiring matching _three_ tiles, and with the ability to "hold" tiles to uncover others.

### Review

The gameplay here is pretty simple: match 3 tiles, clear the board. Sure, there are tiles to unlock (70), but they all function exactly the same with the only difference being the simple icon.

Some levels are big and easy, and just tapping sets of 3 as you see them is completely fine. Others are small and technical, and will require carefully picking up tiles to uncover matches.

It's hard to write much about Tile Collector as... there really isn't much here! Every level plays similarly, tiles are unlocked via a gacha-y mechanic earned through number of matches, and there's no extra functionality. The screenshots below cover the entire game.

With all that being said, I could see myself putting a few hours into grinding through the levels (similar to [Puzzlerama](android-game-reviews-feb24/#1-puzzlerama)), if it wasn't for the...

### Monetisation

Constant adverts. Adverts at the bottom of the screen throughout, plus obnoxious 5-10 second adverts between _every_ level. This means you'll be spending around 10 seconds watching adverts per 60 seconds of gameplay, not even considering the constant on-screen presence.

These non-stop adverts are pretty distracting when trying to solve a supposedly minimalist puzzle game, and completely undermine the gameplay. To make it worse, there's no ability to pay to remove ads.

### Tips

- Prioritise tiles blocking other tiles (obviously!), there's no benefit to clearing tiles at the bottom.
- Tiles unfortunately completely obscure other tiles. This makes it impossible to know if a tile is actually at the bottom or not.
- There are no benefits to collecting a "rare" tile over a common one, all that matters is clearing the board.
