intro

The games are in descending order of "fun", and might contain mild spoilers:

## #1: [King's Landing](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Creauctopus.KingsLanding)

King's Landing - Idle Arcade was not what I expected. It looked like one of those typical "waiting simulator" incremental games, and I was fully expecting grindy gameplay with constant adverts. It was far better than that!

### Review

King's Landing is clearly early in development from an indie developer, yet has a satisfying core gameplay loop. Collect resources, process them, use them to unlock new areas, buildings, and automation.

There's only a couple of hours of gameplay here, and there's no offline progress. The almost entirely active gameplay will consist solely of walking between buildings that produce resources and areas than require them. New areas and content unlocks frequently, which stops the small number of game items (7-8 in total) becoming too tiring to farm.

Resources can be gathered by employees, and later on this is the only reasonable way to get the large quantities of items required. Essentially you'll primarily be ferrying raw materials from the storage units to processing plants, whilst your employees gather the raw materials.

There's an upgrade system providing a use for coins, but I'd have liked to see it expanded beyond basic "Stone storage stores more" or "Forge processes more at once".

I tried finding out more about the developer, but was left a little confused. There's plenty of games published, but they seem to be unrelated games, with completely different visual styles, descriptions, monetisation, etc. I wondered if "Creauctopus" is some sort of publisher..? [Their website](https://creauctopus.com/) seems to be a solo developer / artist's outdated portfolio, and the developer's bio on linked sites supports this. An impressive range of talent if this really is all from one person!

### Monetisation

There's none! No adverts, no purchases!

### Tips

- Player speed doesn't seem to have much impact, it doesn't seem worth it.
- Selling processed resources is far more profitable than raw.
- Try and keep all processing centres (forge, sawmill, etc) busy at all times, since you'll need a lot of these processed resources.
- Make sure your houses (coin generators) are never full, or they'll stop producing.
- Move items in bulk. There's no point moving a few stones, instead move as many at once as the processing plants can handle. You can then cycle through restocking, maximising efficiency.
