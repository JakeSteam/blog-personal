Every December since 2011, The Yogscast have organised the "Jingle Jam", a collection of streams with [an associated bundle](https://jinglejam.tiltify.com/) with £1100+ of great games to raise money for charity. I'm reviewing all 75+ of them, hopefully finding a few new favourites! Here's part 2 with games 31-60. 

## Rating system

As a reminder, I'll be using the same rating system as last year, essentially it's purely how much I personally enjoy the game, not whether it's good or not. As such, a great game might get a 1/5 if it's not a genre I enjoy, and vice versa. It's the only way to give an honest review!

* **5/5**: I had to stop myself playing this game, I'm very likely to replay this later and complete it.
* **4/5**: This was a good experience, but maybe had problems. I'll likely play it again for a little bit eventually.
* **3/5**: The game was OK. Maybe it was a bit flawed, or just obviously bad game design decisions. I'm unlikely to play it again, but didn't actively dislike it. 
* **2/5**: This was not fun. Maybe it has some positive parts, but overall I didn't enjoy my time playing.
* **1/5**: The game experience was actively unpleasant. I had to force myself to play more than a few minutes of it, and was relieved when I finally closed the game. 

I played most games for at least an hour, but some are pretty small and understood / completed after 15-20 minutes. Information on peak player count are [from SteamDB.info](https://steamdb.info/).

## 5/5 Games

### Train Valley 2

| Steam rating | Price | Description | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [86.52% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/602320) | £11.39 | Train Planning Puzzles | April 2019 | 448 (May 2020) 

I generally don't enjoy train games, which makes it very lucky that Train Valley 2 is actually primarily a puzzle game! The aim of the game is resource management and supply chains, with each level having a set of objects that need to be created.

This starts off easy (get grain, created by sending people to a farm) but quickly ramps up. Once resources require other resources (e.g. cows made from wheat made by people), connecting the necessary buildings can be a challenge. However, the real challenge is getting complacent, and before you know it there'll be a horrendously expensive train crash!

I'll be picking this up again to work through the 50ish levels, there's no time constraints so it's all about planning capability. Sips and Lewis [played this a bit during Jingle Jam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXO7sB1UYk8), worth a watch.

### Tinytopia

| Steam rating | Price | Description | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [80.49% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/968550) | £7.19 | Tiny Town Merging | August 2021 | 170 (August 2021) 

I loved this! I'm an absolute sucker for "merge" style games, and Tinytopia combines this with a city builder. 

Citizens have all the requirements you'd expect (power, jobs, housing), and growing your city is a pretty simple process. Stack some apartments, stack some stores, add some amenities like police stations. 

Interestingly, buildings don't need to be placed particularly sensibly. You can place houses on the tops of other buildings, create a messy pile of small houses, it's chaotic! However, higher levels of each building require placing them in a specific way, and it's quite satisfying when multiple buildings combine at once.

Whilst I did enjoy the first few levels, and I'll be coming back to it, I'm not sure about the longevity it'll have. The 3rd screenshot below shows the wide variety of buildings, but once you've seen them all... what next? Each level has bonus objectives, but they're pretty basic.

There's also farms, monsters, shanty towns, natural disasters, bridges, and much more that I didn't look at yet. Exciting!

### Totally Accurate Battle Simulator

| Steam rating | Price | Description | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [96.43% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/508440) | £15.99 | Chaotic Battle Madness | April 2021 | 13,674 (April 2021)

I've watched Angory Tom play this so, so much! TABS is a core part of the Jingle Jam streams, and one of my favourite yearly events.

As a chaotic battle simulator, you have to make your own fun. This makes it a game that is perhaps more fun to watch than actually play, so here's the last few years of tournaments instead:

### Tiny Life

| Steam rating | Price | Description | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [83.35% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1651490) | £12.79 | Pixelated The Sims | May 2023 | 84 (May 2023)

If you're of a similar age to me, you've probably spent *hundreds* of hours in the original The Sims game from Maxis. Tiny Life is almost identical, but in pixelated form.

There are a few new mechanics, but realistically this is a nostalgic recreation of that 20+ year old game. Every action and objective will be instantly familiar, with the addition of things like pronouns, book titles, etc.

It looks like the developers are intending to implement Steam Workshop for maps and assets, which would be a great way to give this game a life of its own. In the current state, it really is just a pixelised version of The Sims. I love that, but... it's lacking much depth or original ideas.

### Trifox

| Steam rating | Price | Description | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [82.87% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1211240) | £5.99 | Low Poly Platformer | October 2022 | 17 (October 2022)

Trifox's early levels reminded me, oddly enough, of the LEGO games. Exploring a linear level, smashing crates for coins, and killing anything you see. 

Where it differs however, is the ability to choose a "loadout" of equipment, grouped into melee, ranged, and tech. I went for tech as usual, meaning when I unlocked longer distance movement it was a helicopter backpack, and when I unlocked a weapon it was a gun.

The difficulty is well-balanced, with all combat being challenging yet forgiving, and puzzles being solvable without guesswork. You can take a few hits, you can fall into a few holes, you'll be fine once you've had a health potion.

Whilst I did enjoy the gameplay (besides the occasional 3D platforming awkwardness), the story wasn't for me. It's clearly been designed to not require words (so no translation), and is quite slapstick-y. Luckily the combat and puzzles are good enough to ignore the story, and I'm looking forward to seeing what the later game upgrades look like!

### Toodee and Topdee

| Steam rating | Price | Description | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [88.42% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1303950) | £16.75 | Perspective Puzzling | August 2021 | 104 (February 2022) 

This was fun! Shifting between 3D and 2D perspectives to solve puzzles is a fun gimmick, and even a few puzzles in I could see the potential for brain-melting.

However, it's a little awkward playing by yourself, and is definitely one of those things where the game is significantly better with a friend (at least based on gameplay videos).
