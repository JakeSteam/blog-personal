Every December since 2011, The Yogscast have organised the "Jingle Jam", a collection of streams with [an associated bundle](https://jinglejam.tiltify.com/) with £1100+ of great games to raise money for charity. I'm reviewing all 75+ of them, hopefully finding a few new favourites! Here's part 2 with games 31-60. 

## Rating system

As a reminder, I'll be using the same rating system as last year, essentially it's purely how much I personally enjoy the game, not whether it's good or not. As such, a great game might get a 1/5 if it's not a genre I enjoy, and vice versa. It's the only way to give an honest review!

* **5/5**: I had to stop myself playing this game, I'm very likely to replay this later and complete it.
* **4/5**: This was a good experience, but maybe had problems. I'll likely play it again for a little bit eventually.
* **3/5**: The game was OK. Maybe it was a bit flawed, or just obviously bad game design decisions. I'm unlikely to play it again, but didn't actively dislike it. 
* **2/5**: This was not fun. Maybe it has some positive parts, but overall I didn't enjoy my time playing.
* **1/5**: The game experience was actively unpleasant. I had to force myself to play more than a few minutes of it, and was relieved when I finally closed the game. 

I played most games for at least an hour, but some are pretty small and understood / completed after 15-20 minutes. Information on peak player count are [from SteamDB.info](https://steamdb.info/).

Also, here's [part 1 for 2023](/reviewing-every-jingle-jam-2023-game), and 2022's [part 1](/reviewing-every-jingle-jam-steam-game/), [part 2](/reviewing-every-jingle-jam-steam-game-part-2/), and [part 3](/reviewing-every-jingle-jam-steam-game-part-3/).

## 5/5 Games

### Train Valley 2

| Steam rating | Price | Description | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [86.52% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/602320) | £11.39 | Train Planning Puzzles | April 2019 | 448 (May 2020) 

I generally don't enjoy train games, which makes it very lucky that Train Valley 2 is actually primarily a puzzle game! The aim of the game is resource management and supply chains, with each level having a set of objects that need to be created.

This starts off easy (get grain, created by sending people to a farm) but quickly ramps up. Once resources require other resources (e.g. cows made from wheat made by people), connecting the necessary buildings can be a challenge. However, the real challenge is getting complacent, and before you know it there'll be a horrendously expensive train crash!

I'll be picking this up again to work through the 50ish levels, there's no time constraints so it's all about planning capability. Sips and Lewis [played this a bit during Jingle Jam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXO7sB1UYk8), worth a watch.

## 4/5 Games

## Totally Accurate Battle Simulator

| Steam rating | Price | Description | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [96.43% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/508440) | 15.99 | Chaotic Battle Madness | April 2021 | 13,674 (April 2021)

I've watched Angory Tom play this so, so much! TABS is a core part of the Jingle Jam streams, and one of my favourite yearly events.

As a chaotic battle simulator, you have to make your own fun. This makes it a game that is perhaps more fun to watch than actually play, so here's the last few years of tournaments instead:

## 3/5 Games

### Toodee and Topdee

| Steam rating | Price | Description | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [88.42% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1303950) | £16.75 | Perspective Puzzling | August 2021 | 104 (February 2022) 

This was fun! Shifting between 3D and 2D perspectives to solve puzzles is a fun gimmick, and even a few puzzles in I could see the potential for brain-melting.

However, it's a little awkward playing by yourself, and is definitely one of those things where the game is significantly better with a friend (at least based on gameplay videos).
