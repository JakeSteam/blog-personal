I spent a couple of weeks in December making my way through central Europe, starting with a few days in Switzerland's Zurich. As always, I managed to fit quite a lot in, including one of the best experiences of my life (Jungfraujoch). Here are all the reviews!

*Note: This is part 1 of 4 from this trip: Zurich, [Vienna](/vienna-reviews), [Prague](/prague-reviews), and [Berlin](berlin-reviews).*

## Day 1 (16th December): Arrival

Our flight was very smooth, although it was a bit of a surprise how busy it was outside Zurich's main station in terms of people, trains, trams, taking us 10 minutes to walk a couple of hundred yards to the hotel! Once checked in we grabbed dinner at the Christmas market and that was us done for the day: **a measly 11,332 steps (4.49 miles) walked**

### Zürcher Weihnachtsallee ★★★★★

An excellent Christmas market, with a wide variety of food and drink. Impressively, there's plenty of seating spread throughout, including little huts with comfy seating. It's worth looking at the whole market before picking a meal, since my favourites were at the very end.

### Te Nana GmbH ★★★★★

I came across Te Nana when I visited Zurich recently, and they were nestled away in the Christmas market. The staff were super helpful with picking a meal, and it was absolutely delicious! Highly recommend, I hope they keep appearing at other markets.

### Ruby Mimi Hotel & Bar ★★★✰✰

Ruby Mimi is in an excellent location, being both near Zurich's main station and the Limmat river, making it easy to get anywhere in central or east Zurich. However, some of the room design choices are questionable. 

We booked a "Lovely Room", offering slightly more room than a regular double. The room layout was bizarre, with a large empty space at one end, yet barely any space to squeeze past the bottom of the bed to access it. The shower was also open by default to the rest of the room, with a shower curtain on the *outside*. Similarly, the toilet itself had frosted glass instead of actual walls. In addition, there was zero storage space besides a narrow shelf running the length of the room, so all clothes etc will be out in the open. Why?

All of this results in a somewhat unsettling experience when staying with someone else, a little bit of privacy is nice sometimes, even from your partner! 

Finally, the breakfast is pretty limited. No cooked food, it instead consists of deli meat / cheese and breads, with a bit of salad. It's *okay*, but less than I've experienced in most other hotels.

## Day 2 (17th December): Sightseeing

This was a bit of an "all over the place day", with the goal of essentially seeing all the main sights of the city. We did pretty well, even managing a few optional extras including a late night bubble tea run! I didn't review things we only saw in passing, such as Grossmünster or Zürich Opera House.

It was a long day, with **19,203 steps (8.36 miles) walked**.

### Café Elena ★★★★✰

Entering this café felt a bit like walking into an Instagram photoshoot! Check out all the roses in other photos.

Whilst the food was a little pricey, and their interpretation of an English Breakfast bagel was... unique, it was all delicious. It's pretty popular, so I'd recommend coming here for breakfast not brunch. The Turkish coffee was excellent.

### Platzspitz ★★★★★

Whilst this small park is a good way of navigating to the North-East of the city, it's also a decent place. There's plenty of dog-walkers around, and the rivers on either side gives it a very "open" feel. Worth routing through if convenient.

### Platzspitzwehr ★★★★★

A relaxing noisy weir! The viewing area is a little bit dirty, with graffiti and trash, but it's still worth watching for a few minutes before moving on with your day.

### Swiss National Museum ★★★★★

Well worth visiting if you're in Zurich. The Swiss National Museum has a variety of exhibits (always in English & German) covering both the recent and historical Swiss past. This includes kid friendly activities like a 3D map of the country, restored classical rooms, as well as ancient artefacts.

I visited at Christmas and there was a special exhibition with various interpretations of the "three wise men", and their evolution over time. 

The entrance is the doors below the "Landesmuseum" sign, with the ticket desk in front and the shop off to the left. Note that after completing the first floor there is a very long staircase up to the top, with the main museum continuing from the top down in a confusing labyrinth. There may be a better way to navigate, but I didn't find it! 

It was very quiet when we visited, with most rooms after the first floor having nobody else in. This made it a very relaxing experience, to be explored at our own pace.

### Lindenhof ★★★★★

A small concrete area with great views across the river, populated with a few tourists and plenty of locals playing giant chess and similar games. A peaceful and quiet spot for a short rest before diving back into the narrow city streets.
