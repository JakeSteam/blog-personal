_Note: This is a series of posts, with Tokyo [Part 1](/japan-part-1-tokyo/), Takayama [Part 2](/japan-part-2-takayama), Kyoto (this article), and Tokyo [Part 4](/japan-part-4-tokyo/)._

## Day 1 (30th August): Arrival

Our first afternoon in Kyoto, we spent most of it in Nishiki Market, with a dinner reservation booked before any other activity on our trip! A total of **12,949 steps (5.59 miles)**.

### Good Nature Hotel ★★★★✰

A hotel in an excellent location, close to various transport networks to get around Kyoto. Rooms themselves are spacious and well laid out, although the circular layout can mean quite a long walk to your room if on the opposite side to the elevators.

Breakfast has a good array of western and Japanese items, although it can get a bit busy so going early is recommended. I experienced my half-finished drink + food being removed twice before I'd finished (despite having a "table in use" card down) as I went to get refills etc, which was a little annoying.

There are unfortunately no self-service laundry facilities available (except very expensive hotel-provided laundry, 500 yen for a pair of socks!), an inconvenience during longer stays. The TV has internet, Netflix, Prime etc, and air con is controlled via a tablet.

Overall the location makes this a good hotel, with floors dedicated to an expensive organic / natural food store, massages, etc.

### Nishiki Market ★★★★★

Definitely a Kyoto highlight. This very long market is full of all kinds of meat, seafood, desserts, drinks, souvenirs, and snacks. Stores are densely packed in, and you'll see new ones every time you walk through!

It can be very crowded, but it's the best place to go if you're after a snack and not sure exactly what. Shop owners don't try to convince you to come in, letting you take your time and pick which shop to go into.

### Maisen-Do ★★★★★

A small shop offering various souvenirs and fans. The helpful staff can engrave your fan with Kanji for a small fee, and the comes in a very attractive gift box, making it the perfect present!

### Food court ★★★★★

As with much of Nishiki Market, it's almost impossible to know exactly which shop you're ordering from, but luckily this food court has something for everyone! We ate at the large tempura shop by the entrance, getting some additional snacks from further down inside the food court.

Eating space is quite limited (you'll need to stand at various small table spaces), but this is more than worth it for being able to try lots of different foods all in one place. Some stalls work using a handheld "beeper" when your food is ready, others will hand a pre-prepared item to you directly. We didn't go too far in, but I think there may be seating available.

### Ochanokosaisai ★★★★✰

A quite busy store selling seasoning and snacks. We purchased some very popular spicy rice seasoning, at checkout we spotted photos of it being tried on a Japanese TV show!

### KUMONOCHA ★★★★✰

A surprisingly spacious and calm seating area within Nishiki Market, primarily selling very sweet snacks and drinks (we had warabimochi). The food is very aesthetically pleasing, so be aware you'll pay a premium for this!

### Samurai Ninja Museum ★★★✰✰

A mixed experience, the somewhat odd combination of being guided through detailed exhibits as part of a tour meant not quite being able to listen fully, and also not being able to read fully. I'd have preferred looking through in my own time, but understand it's an interactive experience! Our tour did not include the dress-up experience, so this might be time-dependant.

The tour included background information on ninjas and feudal Japan, sword making, armour, and similar topics. An opportunity was given to hold real and replica swords & spears, as well as a friendly (plastic) shuriken throwing competition within the group of 20 or so. Booking in advance is recommended, we luckily found last minute seats at a desired time.

There's a small shop at the end, mostly selling things that would not be legal to carry in many countries!

### Hikiniku to Come ★★★★★

An excellent experience that is worth the hype! After booking a month in advance and entering after a short queue (make sure you don't accidentally enter via the side exit!), we had a seat at the round eating area.

3 burgers are provided one at a time to you, along with unlimited rice, an egg for one "course", and 8+ toppings and seasonings in shared pots in front of you. You can watch the burgers being cooked, and the simple method doesn't reveal how they manage to taste so juicy!

The atmosphere is friendly and bustling, with chefs shouting hello & goodbye to patrons, and each seat feeling somewhat private whilst still having a great view.
