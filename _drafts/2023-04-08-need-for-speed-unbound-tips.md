Whilst I was waiting for FH5's Rally DLC, I finally got round to buying Need For Speed Unbound and putting 30+ hours into it. Here's what I learned along the way (without spoilers), give it a quick read if you're having trouble with the game!

## General tips

### 1. Learn to handle the heat

If you can consistently escape heat level 5, the game becomes easy. The risk vs reward breaks, and you can easily do as many events as you want! I played the standard edition game through on "Challenging" difficulty, and had a somewhat frustrating experience until I tried out some new tactics.

There's a collection of tips further down in [police chase tips](#police-chase-tips), but this "escape the police" skill is going to be essential to actually complete the game.

### 2. Unlock every gas station

During police chases, finding a gas station can be what makes or breaks your escape. During normal gameplay, always go out of your way to drive close enough to gas stations to display them on the overall map. Luckily, they have pretty distinctive blue / red branding! 

### 3. Put in the minimum effort for collectibles 

Whilst driving around, a green circle will appear on the minimap when near a collectible. Driving close to the collectible (billboard / balloon / street art) will display it on the minimap and the overall map. 

Since this usually only takes a few seconds, it should be done whenever possible. 

### 4. Oncoming traffic nitro is useful

If you're in the left-hand lane, you'll slowly gain nitro. You'll also get more "temporary" nitro from near misses (as they're much faster), and at lower car classes there's no real reason to drive on the correct side of the road!

At S+ class the oncoming traffic can be a bit hard to see in time, especially during the day, so only do it when safe. On the plus side, you'll be going so much faster than overtaking other cars will give you decent near miss bonuses.

### 5. Side missions are the best events

### 6. Don't worry about drifting

### 7. Know when to quit

### 8. Plan your race order

### 9. Save your restarts

## Race tips

### 10. Surviving is top priority

### 11. Drafting is essential

### 12. 2nd place might be better

### 13. Always race dirty

### 14. Don't trust police cars

## Police chase tips

### 15. Proactively take out police

### 16. Find "safe" areas

### 17. Helicopters are worse than they seem

### 18. Not every police vehicle is equal

### 19. Fast offroad jumps are your escape plan

### 20. Damage prevention is the best investment 

### 21. Driving in a circle is surprisingly effective
