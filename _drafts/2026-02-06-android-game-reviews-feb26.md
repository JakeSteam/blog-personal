## #1: [Droplet Idle](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mhsolutions.droplet)

I originally found this simple-but-satisfying idle collecting game via [a dev post on r/incremental_games](https://www.reddit.com/r/incremental_games/comments/1qejjw1/droplet_idle_cozy_incremental_game_androidios/), and I've been checking it a few times a day for a couple of weeks now!

### Screenshots

All screenshots are from version 1.1.8:

### Review

Droplet Idle starts undeniably slow. After ~5 minutes I actually closed the game and was pretty ready to uninstall, as it seemed to just consist of swiping the screen to collect the slowly spawning water drops, upgrading drop value etc, and repeat.

Luckily, I gave it another go, and it's got a lot more going on! Once the momentum of droplet spawning & auto-collecting & auto-upgrading picks up, the game reveals itself to be worth putting time into. Alongside the typical ugprades (droplet value, spawn rate, offline time, etc) are longer term prestige mechanics. Whilst these aren't dissimilar, they are powerful enough (e.g. double income) to be immediately felt.

Interestingly, these prestige upgrades _aren't_ entirely permanent. Instead, they will reset on the very rare occasion that you change location, something I've only managed to do once so far (but can afford the next movement). Persisting through these are a truly permanent upgrade mechanic: prestige talents. Split into active, passive, and utility, these abilities let you customise your bonuses based on playstyle, and can be redistributed at any time for free.

The developer is clearly listening to feedback, with essentially every criticism from the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/incremental_games/comments/1qejjw1/droplet_idle_cozy_incremental_game_androidios/) addressed, and it even updated the day before writing this review with minor redesigns and bug fixes! I'm confident it has a lot of potential, although I worry how many other players won't push through the initial slow gameplay.

Whilst there's no story or narrative whatsoever besides numbers go up, progressing through the areas (I'm on "City", next is "Tropical Forest") to unlock new backgrounds is enough of a motivation for now. It's also worth mentioning that the quality of life upgrades such as auto-upgrade and idle prestige currency gain are quite early on, meaning the game _can be_ fully idle if desired.

The game also includes an interesting achievements system. 8 metrics (total offline time, prestiges, droplets collected, etc) have up to 18 "tiers", where each new tier gives an increased relevant bonus. For example, I'm currently tier 8 total offline time (2 days), tier 9 (3 days) would give me +5% offline earnings, a small but noticeable bonus. Additionally, in the most recent update, 1.5x income multipliers were added for being an early adopter (playing before March 2026), completing the game early, or finding a game breaking bug. Nice!

Overall the gameplay loop is not complex, but it's a straightforward dopamine drip-feed (no pun intended). The need to balance immediate upgrades vs overall prestige value is typical for the genre, as is the lack of any way to lose progress or do any active gameplay besides swipe the screen to collect.

Regardless, it's a solid candidate for your next "check occasionally" game, and I'm sure the future upgrades will continue to improve it!

### Monetisation

- There are banner adverts, but they can be disabled in exchange for losing 15% of income. This is a great trade-off, and lets users who would uninstall (me!) continue playing at a reduced speed.
- Adverts can be watched for a 20 minute 2x multiplier, a reasonable rate. Additionally, due to the achievment tiers, watching more adverts actually increases the per advert benefit, with 200 advert watches in the bonus becoming permanent!
- All adverts can also be removed for £3.49 (~$5).

These options are suitably varied, and I haven't felt pressured whatsoever to buy them yet (primarily since all adverts are optional). Personally I'd appreciate an additional in-app payment to permanently increase income or similar, as an extra incentive to spend some money, an action I'm currently unlikely to take due to lack of incentive.

### Tips

- Occasionally turn off your auto-upgrade to see if you are near a new upgrade tier (e.g. 50, 100), listed below each upgrade type. Saving up to get to these can be far more efficient than upgrading everything equally.
- Moving to a new location resets your prestige bonuses but not talents, so make sure you have purchased as many talents as reasonably possible before moving.
- Offline progress is fairly limited in both time and impact even after quite a few upgrades, so if possible it's a good "keep open and swipe occasionally" game.
- The game [has a website](https://dropletidle.com/), but no Discord / subreddit.
