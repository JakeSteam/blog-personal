### Zombie Rollerz: Pinball Heroes

Zombie Rollerz was a pleasantly surprising pinball / RPG hybrid, with waaaay more depth than expected. Each level seems to be uniquely crafted, although of course the enemies and gameplay mechanics are shared.

Whilst I only completed the first 2 chapters, there is definitely a lot of "brain off" fun to be had here. The levels were very easy, mostly due to the overwhelming amount of *stuff* happening at any time. You have 4 "powerups" activated by the XYAB buttons, a ball action activated by LB, and various effects happening on the dynamic board. This causes every level I played to be beatable by just firing the ball randomly and spamming powerups when available.

However, there seems to be a pretty deep loadout system, with each ball powerup having multiple levels, and overworld with loot and puzzle levels, as well as enough variety to easily come back to the game over and over again.

### You Suck At Parking

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [79.09% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/837880/You_Suck_at_Parking/) | £16.99 | Racing | September 2022 | 110 (September 2022) |

Take your average indie game with a fun little premise, say... parking in parking spots with limited fuel. Now inject a heavy dose of aggressive monetisation: lootboxes, season passes, microtransactions, anything to make money. The result? You Suck At Parking.

The core campaign of this game is what I was mostly expecting the game to be, relatively simple puzzles about finding & parking in all parking spots before running out of time / fuel. The difficulty is a little bit all over the place, but the car control is satisfying and it feels very "fair".

However there is also... an online mode. The premise isn't explained, but you have limited time to find all the parking spots on 4 levels, one after another. However, other players will be driving around too, and they can interact with you (e.g., nudge you off the edge). There's no quick chat / emotes, so the online feels a little lifeless. In fact, I could have been playing with bots my first few matches, although they seemed real.

Overall I can see how someone could get into this game. For me however, the ridiculous cosmetic prices and obvious attempts to extract as much money as possible make it unappealing. If the game was free, and on mobile, the strategy would make sense. Instead however, there's a pretty expensive price tag only to be met with further requests for money once the game opens.

### Warhammer 40k: Gladius - Relics of War

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [77.91% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/489630/Warhammer_40000_Gladius__Relics_of_War/) | £30.99 | Strategy | July 2018 | 3.4k (July 2018) |

I am not a good person to review this game. I've never had any interest in Warhammer 40k, nor 4X / strategy games besides a little bit of Civilization V in the past. By the very nature of these games, they require a time investment of tens if not hundreds of hours before a proper review can be given, and I just didn't find it engaging enough to do that.

I played an hour or so of the tutorial, and the overall impression is that a lot of knowledge is assumed. For Warhammer 40k this is probably a safe assumption most of the time, but it meant I usually had no idea what units / tiles meant. Sometimes my unit would onto a building, sometimes it would attack it, and this unpredictably persisted throughout.

As Civilization 5 (and Settlers III) are the only vaguely similar games I've played, it's hard not to compare this game unfavourably. Every action felt like a less intuitive version, with an excellent example being the monochrome icons used throughout the UI. After 10 hours the icons probably seem obvious, but at first glance they're just mysterious shapes with no meaning or association. 

Finally, the graphics felt pretty muddy. Zooming in should reward the player with a nicely modelled unit, perhaps with some easter egg idle animations and slight variation between individuals whilst still appearing cohesive. Instead, the units (at least the ones I saw) were very low quality, and quickly taught me that keeping the game as zoomed out as possible helped me pretend the game looked alright.
