### The Turing Test

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players

The Turing Test is very, very comparable to Portal. However, unlike games like Q.U.B.E it does not feel like a rip-off, but like a developer has learnt Valve's lessons around subtler storytelling and learning by doing.

New mechanics are slowly introduced every few levels, and instead of a wall of text the only way to learn is to do. Each puzzle is standalone, and the sense of accomplishment when the final piece of the puzzle comes together is amazing. Just as importantly, the solution to each puzzle doesn't feel like a chore to actually implement, as the controls are slick. It also helps that the game is visually appealing, with non-puzzle rooms having lots of hidden extras, whilst puzzle rooms are clean and well laid out.

This game really surprised me, with the first 10-15 minutes playing like a mystery / survival game, before transitioning into the puzzle room solving formula. Throughout these rooms, a very well written two-layer story is told. Without any spoilers, if you don't explore every corner whilst walking between levels, you're going to get a much, much simpler story. Read notes! 

I made it about halfway through the game before I made myself stop, I could easily have played it to completion all day!

### Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [91.46% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1205450/) | £12.99 | Pinball | April 2021 | 341 (April 2021) |

What an astonishing game. The main gameplay is essentially completing fetch quests by talking to everyone you meet, and a bit of combat. The quests are simple, the story is easily understandable, but what sets is apart is the writing.

When completing a quest you usually rip a document in half, starting with the tax bill, hence the game name. Later on this progresses to love letters, notices of military service, and countless random documents. Yes it's a basic gimmick, but other character's reactions to the senseless ripping is beautiful. Every character's dialog is pretty entertaining, and it's a great motivator for completing the next little quest.

The combat is relatively smooth, but nothing too new. Most of it is spent swapping between your melee weapon (used to inflict damage) and your watering can, used to grow helpful plants nearby. You're unlikely to die very often, but the boss fights take a lot of attention and patience to get through safely.

### Tanuki Sunset

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [87.14% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1251460/) | £11.39 | Racing | December 2020 | 75 (December 2020) |

I spent the first 3-4 minutes disliking this game. The speed didn't make sense, the controls weren't responsive, it was way too hard, and resets were way too punishing. Then... it clicked! Suddenly I was drifting around corners, going at maximum speed, and dodging cars easily.

Tanuki Sunset has a synthwave / beach vibe mashup, and once you work past adapting to the controls, it's a solid skateboarding game. Each stage is a few minutes long, and a single failure (very easy to do!) will send you back to the start. 

The complexity comes through a risk/reward mechanic, where you *can* push the analog stick to go faster, perform near misses on cars, and all kinds of other terrifying behaviour, in exchange for more points. These don't seem too useful, whereas "bits" can be used on all kinds of cosmetics and accessories. It's worth keeping in mind that all of the jumps / drifts etc are optional, and staying on the road is waaaay more important.

### The Dungeon Beneath

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [80.18% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1359120/) | £11.39 | Roguelite | October 2020 | 220 (January 2020) |

The Dungeon Beneath is a relatively simple but solidly implemented roguelike dungeon crawler, one of my favourite genres. Your small team of yourself & 4 companions battle through a quite linear dungeon consisting of a series of battles with the occasional campfire or shop. 

I only did a couple of runs, but found the strategy a little bit limited. With only 3 lanes consisting of 2 tiles each, positioning is limited. Additionally, mid-battle companions can only attack *or* move, making moving rarely the right choice. Instead you will usually set up your squad (melee at the front, range at the back, obviously), then repeatedly click "ATTACK" until you die or the enemy does.

Make sure you turn on "stats always visible" and "5x animation speed" to improve the game beyond the default settings. Whilst I was initially thrown by the game using the same icon pack as various mobile games (e.g. Orna RPG), it matches the setting well.

After most runs, a new companion option will be unlocked, giving this game quite a bit of replayability if you enjoy the core strategy. For me, the lack of in-battle strategy stopped this becoming a new favourite.

### Swords 'n Magic and Stuff

| [88.35% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/810040/) | £16.75 | RPG | September 2020 | 547 (September 2020) |

I enjoyed this far more than I thought I would! Swords 'n Magic and Stuff might have an awful name (SM&S?), but it's a quite fleshed out casual RPG. The tutorial does a good job of teaching you the basics of combat, cooking, and similar skills, whilst not holding your hand too much.

The bow & arrow combat was pretty satisfying, especially when combined with the combat roll mechanic. I'm not fully convinced by the default controls (F to pick up, E to swap ammo), they stop being an issue after a while though.

I noticed a lot of focus on multiplayer features, which I'm pretty interested in looking into, since the singleplayer was very much a solo RPG. In terms of graphics it's somewhat basic, but it makes the most of what it has available, with the voxel graphics suiting the gameplay style.

### Zombie Rollerz: Pinball Heroes

| [82.67% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/915230/) | £11.39 | Adventure | March 2022 | 126 (March 2022) |

Zombie Rollerz was a pleasantly surprising pinball / RPG hybrid, with waaaay more depth than expected. Each level seems to be uniquely crafted, although of course the enemies and gameplay mechanics are shared.

Whilst I only completed the first 2 chapters, there is definitely a lot of "brain off" fun to be had here. The levels were very easy, mostly due to the overwhelming amount of *stuff* happening at any time. You have 4 "powerups" activated by the XYAB buttons, a ball action activated by LB, and various effects happening on the dynamic board. This causes every level I played to be beatable by just firing the ball randomly and spamming powerups when available.

However, there seems to be a pretty deep loadout system, with each ball powerup having multiple levels, and overworld with loot and puzzle levels, as well as enough variety to easily come back to the game over and over again.

### Wunderling DX

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [86.61% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/732930/Wunderling_DX/) | £11.39 | Platformer | March 2020 | 16 (March 2022) |

How does this game not have more players!? Wunderling is an automoving puzzle platformer, with one button to jump, then sometimes additional buttons for level-specific actions. The movement is satisfying, the level design encourages risky behaviour (but are still completable), making it a tragedy this game has never had 20 players.

Each of the levels takes under a minute to complete, and whilst just completing it is very easy, the additional incentives (treasure chests with cosmetics) give excellent replayability. I only opened 3-4 chests, but was very tempted to go back and replay earlier levels to figure out how to get the cosmetics out of the missed chests. They often require looping back on yourself, which is easier said than done when you have no control over your movement besides jumping!

The main downside to the game would be the dialog and story. It's aiming to be self-aware, but came across as a bit cringe-inducing, and I quickly started skipping all the cutscenes. Ultimately the story doesn't matter whatsoever, your objectives per level always seem the same, at least at the start.

### Sokpop: Sok-worlds

| [79.89% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1263820/) | £2.99 | Adventure | March 2020 | 23 (November 2022) |

What a surreal experience. Sok-worlds is essentially a sandbox tool for making, sharing, and playing levels that consist entirely of solid images or text. The storylines are baffling and mysterious if they exist, the images are cliché enough to be obviously intentional, and the platforming is as good as it needs to be.

As a creative tool, this game lives and dies on the content. Luckily, the few levels I played were all intriguing and truly unique 2-3 minute adventures. There won't be any magnum opus here, but there's absolutely the chance for niche creator subcommunities.

### You Suck At Parking

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [79.09% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/837880/You_Suck_at_Parking/) | £16.99 | Racing | September 2022 | 110 (September 2022) |

Take your average indie game with a fun little premise, say... parking in parking spots with limited fuel. Now inject a heavy dose of aggressive monetisation: lootboxes, season passes, microtransactions, anything to make money. The result? You Suck At Parking.

The core campaign of this game is what I was mostly expecting the game to be, relatively simple puzzles about finding & parking in all parking spots before running out of time / fuel. The difficulty is a little bit all over the place, but the car control is satisfying and it feels very "fair".

However there is also... an online mode. The premise isn't explained, but you have limited time to find all the parking spots on 4 levels, one after another. However, other players will be driving around too, and they can interact with you (e.g., nudge you off the edge). There's no quick chat / emotes, so the online feels a little lifeless. In fact, I could have been playing with bots my first few matches, although they seemed real.

Overall I can see how someone could get into this game. For me however, the ridiculous cosmetic prices and obvious attempts to extract as much money as possible make it unappealing. If the game was free, and on mobile, the strategy would make sense. Instead however, there's a pretty expensive price tag only to be met with further requests for money once the game opens.

### WARSAW

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [69.97% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1026420/WARSAW/) | £18.99 | Strategy | October 2019 | 351 (October 2019) |

WARSAW felt like a game with a lot of potential, that could have been a cult classic if it had got luckier and made a few different decisions. The setting (Poland's uprising at the end of WW2) is convincing, and the mood is as depressing and oppressive as you'd expect. 

The map used to navigate a scenario is a little confusing. You have limited energy (used by movement) which discourages exploration, flanking, or strategic positioning, with the intended approach seemingly being to charge head-first into any enemies you see. Once you're in combat, it seems pretty shallow, with the turn based combat (move OR shoot, then enemy does) leading to the best tactic just being taking it in turns to exchange fire until one team is all dead. 

This simple combat system is slow, even on the 3x speed setting. Every battle will take quite a few turns, and it's not particularly engaging when the only strategy I saw was to hide behind obstacles. Attacks have certain tiles they can target, which led to very silly scenarios where I was clicking through my 4 characters, trying to find any that could target a man standing right in front of us. Just shoot!

Overall this isn't my sort of game, nor did I find the complexity of asset management vs simplicity of combat very engaging. If Darkest Dungeon didn't exist, WARSAW might have been more appealing.

| [77.40% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1459870/) | £2.09 | Strategy | October 2020 | 13 (December 2022) |

As with most Sokpop games, it's a pretty basic take on a genre. This time, it's a strategy game where resource gathering (food, wood, gold) must be balanced against expansion of your settlement. The usual choices are here, do you buy new workers or a soldier in case the enemy attacks?

The UI is a little bit awkward, but the short and sweet game is self-explanatory and worth the purchase. The story is light, but enough to make the battles make sense.

| [90.93% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1264520/) | £11.39 | Puzzle | July 2020 | 103 (February 2021) |

This is a beautiful, complex game with a high skill ceiling. That skill ceiling is clearly much, much higher than my ability.

I've played a few similar games before, with the core concept of swapping between multiple characters each with unique abilities. *Usually* however, these characters just need to be swapped between to open a gate / pass an obstacle. In Vibrant Venture you need to swap mid-jump, to perform tricks like utilising one character's vertical double jump immediately followed by another character's horizontal dash. 

I only played the first few levels, but every time I had to do this move my hands disobeyed me, and it took far too many attempts! The pixel art was absolutely lovely, and it's a real shame this game wasn't more of a hit. Maybe others are as incompetent as me!

| [79.11% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1061610/) | £19.49 | Strategy | October 2020 | 64 (October 2020) |

It's hard to review this game, since I never felt I really had a grasp of what was actually going on. I of course understood I was navigating around a map, and could enter battles, but the controls (at least on controller) seemed almost random. It was never clear which character was selected, why I was fighting enemies, or what the point of anything was.

There was a mysterious "flying" mode which showed the same area, just from a higher perspective. Whilst this might potentially be used for scouting, the bizarre objects popping in and out of view constantly made it useless. Finally, the game's start was quite abrupt, with the start seemingly just being a collection of non-speaking characters (called goblins?) dumped in a field near some enemies (also goblins?).

A good strategy game might be hiding under here, but I didn't see any hints of it in my short time playing.

Okay wait wait wait, I know this game is amazing! It's just not for me. I've watched tens of hours of Viscera Cleanup Detail from people like [Hatfilms](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW1Yb5N9dD8datIoAFMCCOrbsR5AY5bMv), [Sips & Lewis](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNLcbFFtu7nXNiQeSkwTjvAEBVF8Ev3Iz), and [Jerma & Ster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbYuruOBbG0), and the multiplayer element feels essential. Without someone there to knock over your bucket full of blood, the game just feels like a chore simulator.

Whilst I know games like that can be popular, they're not what I look for personally. I found the control a little fiddly, navigating maps slow, and overall it mostly just reminded me of areas of my house I need to clean! That being said, the maps are fun to explore, and the boombox's tracks is great.

### Warhammer 40k: Gladius - Relics of War

| [77.91% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/489630/Warhammer_40000_Gladius__Relics_of_War/) | £30.99 | Strategy | July 2018 | 3.4k (July 2018) |

I am not a good person to review this game. I've never had any interest in Warhammer 40k, nor 4X / strategy games besides a little bit of Civilization V in the past. By the very nature of these games, they require a time investment of tens if not hundreds of hours before a proper review can be given, and I just didn't find it engaging enough to do that.

I played an hour or so of the tutorial, and the overall impression is that a lot of knowledge is assumed. For Warhammer 40k this is probably a safe assumption most of the time, but it meant I usually had no idea what units / tiles meant. Sometimes my unit would onto a building, sometimes it would attack it, and this unpredictably persisted throughout.

As Civilization 5 (and Settlers III) are the only vaguely similar games I've played, it's hard not to compare this game unfavourably. Every action felt like a less intuitive version, with an excellent example being the monochrome icons used throughout the UI. After 10 hours the icons probably seem obvious, but at first glance they're just mysterious shapes with no meaning or association. 

Finally, the graphics felt pretty muddy. Zooming in should reward the player with a nicely modelled unit, perhaps with some easter egg idle animations and slight variation between individuals whilst still appearing cohesive. Instead, the units (at least the ones I saw) were very low quality, and quickly taught me that keeping the game as zoomed out as possible helped me pretend the game looked alright.

I didn't enjoy The Hex's multiple game styles (one per character) or overall UX much, which unfortunately outweighed the not-bad writing. Dialog took too long to get through, and self-awareness gimmick wore off a bit too closely when all the interactions felt clumsy and muddy.

I only played through the first character's "flashback" and half the second character's, before I'd had enough. Most other reviews praise the stories, so I suspect if I could have overlooked the actual gameplay it may have been a better experience. But, it's a game, it needs solid gameplay!

A hard game to review. As with many other games, this is clearly extremely heavily FTL inspired. The 3D space view is frankly baffling, making it very hard to actually navigate to any quest objectives.

I suspect playing this game for a few more hours would make the overall controls a bit more understandable, but so far I've spent most of my time just blindly following a tutorial. 

From reading other reviews on Steam, this looks like a watered down copy of the developer's other game "Bomber Crew", and that certainly seems accurate comparing screenshots. Whilst I appreciate FTL's effect on the genre, I wish it was a bit less direct!

This is a ~30m "game" with almost zero gameplay, even for a walking simulator. You walk painfully slowly in any direction (it doesn't matter), and click flowers when the slow, meandering voiceover lets you. There is nothing else.

The voiceover should have been an audiobook, or ideally an article, not a game.

Honestly this wasn't a very fun experience. It's just a platformer with bad physics, rough UI, settings that don't reliably work, and just an overall unhappy time. There *might* be some interesting gameplay mechanics later on, but there was certainly nothing new in the tutorial.

I guess Uligo isn't technically bad, but it was a real effort to get through the 2 tutorial levels. Don't play this.

### The Galactic Junkers

If FTL didn't exist, maybe this would have some interest. This is just FTL without the responsiveness, the cohesive storytelling, the tactics, or the love. 

The space-level navigation is borderline impossible, moving within the ship is pretty tricky, and combat vs another ship is a ridiculous mess. Expect your crewmembers to get stuck in walls most of the time, and have zero survival instinct. Overall I really can't recommend this game to anyone, I've absolutely no idea why the Steam page claims it is "comedic".
