intro

## #1: [cube farm](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tarotfocus.cubefarm)

I can't stop opening this game every 7 hours to harvest & replant crops. Help me.

### Review

Okay, so cube farm is a simple concept: you have a farm with 3x3 plots. Then a layer up you have a farm with a 3x3 grid of 3x3 plots. Then a layer up from _that_ you have a farm with a 3x3 grid of 3x3 x 3x3 farms! I originally found it on launch day via [r/incremental_games](https://www.reddit.com/r/incremental_games/comments/1flan7c/cube_farm_international_launch_today_on_mobile/).

You only have 3 crop types (tomato, carrot, corn), with each new plot costing the same amount of each. Whilst this starts off cheap (1 of each, taking ~7 seconds), the price to purchase a new plot increases with every purchase. Before long, a new plot costs tens of thousands of every crop!

Farming this many individually would be impossible, so you instead "combine" plots together once the 3x3 grid is purchased. This allows you to plant / harvest in bulk, and takes 60x longer (7 mins instead of 7 seconds) yet yields ~180x as much! And of course, going another layer up has the same effect (7 hours instead of 7 mins), yielding a ridiculous amount of resources.

And when you finally manage to unlock all 729 plots in the top layer? You prestige, increasing all yields by 10x but keeping your increased price per plot! After a few iterations, you start to unlock features like the market, where you can buy and sell your resources to take advantage of massive yields whilst still progressing.

There's also a "gooster" minigame, tiny blob pets that recharge HP when you harvest their preferred crop, and can fight other blobs to level up. There doesn't seem to be any point to them yet, although mine aren't at the level where they can perform the mysterious "combine". You can use "goo" (obtained from combat) to unlock rarer goosters, and obtain limited edition ones from the dev's social media.

It's an extremely minimal game, with no options, no almost no stats, no quests, very little guidance beyond endlessly buying plots and farming ever greater numbers of vegetables. That being said, the understated nature is part of what makes it so appealing. Instead of demanding all your attention, cube farm leaves it entirely up to you how much you want to interact with the game, and won't remind you with notifications etc. It's almost a zen experience.

Interestingly, it looks like the game [originally came from a Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tarotfocus/cube-farm), and the "primary goals" seem to have been met excellently:

> - develop a high quality mobile game without ads or pay-to-win mechanics
> - designed for quick sessions and background progress, mimic real gardening
> - provide an intentional alternative to scrolling and other phone addictions
> - offer long term progression through a well-balanced prestige system

Overall, you've essentially experienced all of the game as soon as you've tried combining a 3x3 grid into 1, yet there's something relentlessly satisfying about it. I'm on my 3rd prestige, and apparently the next prestige will provide yet another layer of farm, for a total of 6.5k plots! It might also let me save up 1B gold for a "tractor".

### Monetisation

There's almost none. You can donate money to the developer or pay for a cosmetic gooster skin, but they provide no benefits and are hidden away in a menu.

### Tips

- After a prestige, grind 7 second plots until you've at least got a few 3x3 grids ready, then similarly grind 7 minute plots until you have a few of the 3x3x3x3 grids, otherwise progress will be slowly.
- When collecting your crops, make sure to use any roosters as they recharge (from the harvesting) otherwise you'll "waste" some of their potential health.
- Use the market extensively. You'll lose out on every trade, but the additional progress made is more than worth it.
- The higher layers don't show an accurate preview of the crops within (e.g. locked / unlocked status, or crop within) so make sure to click down to look.

## #2: [Idle Space Soldier](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.RubbleGames.IdleSpaceSoldier)

This sidescrolling autoshooter entered early access [in late September], and I downloaded mostly for the appearance and setting. It's a pretty basic incremental, but I'm a big fan of the overall retro-y sci-fi-y aesthetic, it reminds me of old Game Boy Advance games! Whilst it seems a bit bare bones for now, it definitely has potential.

### Review

The gameplay is very straightforward. Your space soldier & his drone move to the right shooting enemies, they drop gold that is used to buy upgrades. That's it! Boss fights happen every 10 levels, and if you die you respawn at the start of that 10-level stretch. There's no additional mechanics or penalty for dying, it's just checking you're upgraded enough.

The soldier's 12 upgrades themselves are pretty typical, things like more blaster damage, dodge chance, critical hit chances. Similarly, the drone's 6 upgrades are assists like healing ability, chance to drop more loot, and other things you'd expect from a companion.

The game does a good job of telling you what upgrades will actually do, by showing the _current_ value, the _next_ value, and the price to upgrade. Long pressing most things in the game also provides a bit more information, although the game is simple enough to not need this often.

Unfortunately this simple straightforward gameplay is also the game's downfall. Ultimately everything in the game comes down to minor improvements to various stats, none of which make a significant difference. For example, there are a few extra features like a "boost" that can be used every couple of minutes and "time crystals" that are used after each prestige to purchase perks, but they don't... really matter.

Similarly, an "intel log" and "feat log" providing minor perks as you kill more enemies and progress through the game, but the perks don't change the gameplay whatsoever. Player upgrades costing 0.1% less, healing 4hp per stage, 2% increased dodge chance? None of these are noticeable.

No matter what you upgrade, you're still going to be grinding through stages buying hundreds of small upgrades until you are clearly too weak for a boss, then you'll prestige and begin again. The enemy & environment artwork is nice, but not enough to motivate length gaming sessions.

Finally, it's a little unfortunate that the game doesn't scale to screen size, and instead has a large black bar at the bottom and gradient bar at the top. This extra vertical space could be used to avoid only displaying 2-3 upgrades at once!

### Monetisation

There's very little! You can watch an advert to double income for 20 minutes, increase prestige bonuses by 25% and other minor perks, but none of them are at all required.

### Tips

- When the game nudges you to prestige (enter the time portal), it's worth doing! I waited far too long.
- The game's "tips" screen has additional pages (as do most screens), there's lots of info hidden in there.
- Idle income seems quite low, so you're better off leaving the game open.
- There's a (quite small) [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/WwqQVHQ4Qa) where the dev is very active in responding to any feedback.

### Screenshots

All screenshots are from version 0.9.8:
