## #2: [Idle Space Soldier](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.RubbleGames.IdleSpaceSoldier)

This sidescrolling autoshooter entered early access [in late September], and I downloaded mostly for the appearance and setting. It's a pretty basic incremental, but I'm a big fan of the overall retro-y sci-fi-y aesthetic, it reminds me of old Game Boy Advance games! Whilst it seems a bit bare bones for now, it definitely has potential.

### Review

The gameplay is very straightforward. Your space soldier & his drone move to the right shooting enemies, they drop gold that is used to buy upgrades. That's it! Boss fights happen every 10 levels, and if you die you respawn at the start of that 10-level stretch. There's no additional mechanics or penalty for dying, it's just checking you're upgraded enough.

The soldier's 12 upgrades themselves are pretty typical, things like more blaster damage, dodge chance, critical hit chances. Similarly, the drone's 6 upgrades are assists like healing ability, chance to drop more loot, and other things you'd expect from a companion.

The game does a good job of telling you what upgrades will actually do, by showing the _current_ value, the _next_ value, and the price to upgrade. Long pressing most things in the game also provides a bit more information, although the game is simple enough to not need this often.

Unfortunately this simple straightforward gameplay is also the game's downfall. Ultimately everything in the game comes down to minor improvements to various stats, none of which make a significant difference. For example, there are a few extra features like a "boost" that can be used every couple of minutes and "time crystals" that are used after each prestige to purchase perks, but they don't... really matter.

Similarly, an "intel log" and "feat log" providing minor perks as you kill more enemies and progress through the game, but the perks don't change the gameplay whatsoever. Player upgrades costing 0.1% less, healing 4hp per stage, 2% increased dodge chance? None of these are noticeable.

No matter what you upgrade, you're still going to be grinding through stages buying hundreds of small upgrades until you are clearly too weak for a boss, then you'll prestige and begin again. The enemy & environment artwork is nice, but not enough to motivate length gaming sessions.

Finally, it's a little unfortunate that the game doesn't scale to screen size, and instead has a large black bar at the bottom and gradient bar at the top. This extra vertical space could be used to avoid only displaying 2-3 upgrades at once!

### Monetisation

There's very little! You can watch an advert to double income for 20 minutes, increase prestige bonuses by 25% and other minor perks, but none of them are at all required.

### Tips

- When the game nudges you to prestige (enter the time portal), it's worth doing! I waited far too long.
- The game's "tips" screen has additional pages (as do most screens), there's lots of info hidden in there.
- Idle income seems quite low, so you're better off leaving the game open.
