intro

The games are in descending order of "fun", and might contain mild spoilers:

## #1: [Wordathlon](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.legenbearygames.wordathlon.word.matrix.puzzle)

A game recommended by the Play Store that I didn't hate! Wordathlon is all about making 5-letter words to solve the grid, excellent if you like anagrams.

### Review

The gameplay of Wordathlon is extremely simple, and the first level plays identically to the 50th. You have a pool of letters, and need to solve the 4 "edges" using words that form a loop.

These correct words are predetermined, so there's not much strategy (although there is a bit, see "Tips"). Whilst it could get frustrating trying to guess words with no clues, the game makes the clever decision to reward you for incorrect guesses. So long as you spell a valid word, you'll solve one of the letters around the edge. This means you could technically solve an entire puzzle without getting any of the 4 words!

Similar to [Wordiest](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.concreterose.wordiest), Wordathlon also has a kind of very casual multiplayer. Upon loading each puzzle, you'll be told what percentage of players got this far. This is surprisingly high, with only around 0.2-0.5% of users stopping at each puzzle! 

For example, 76.15% of players reached level 42, with each level taking a couple of minutes. It's nice seeing this percentage slowly go down, although I am a little scared of how many puzzles it will take to get in the top 10%... my guess is at least 1000.

There's also a daily changing puzzle that rewards a few clues for completion. It's a simple game, but if you enjoy the gameplay I assume it goes on for a very long time.

### Monetisation

Unfortunately the game has adverts. You'll receive a 5-10 second advert after every puzzle, and sometimes even have them at the bottom of the screen. The adverts at the bottom specifically really jar with the relaxing, laid back vibe of the game, and are far too distracting.

Usually I would purchase the ad-free upgrade, especially as it seems to be the only purchase available, but it's Â£7 ($9)! That's far too much, and around twice what I'd expect from a game, especially one as simple as this.

Additionally, purchasing the "ad free" option still includes watching adverts for extra hints, so it's actually "no forced ads". I might end up buying it, but if it was cheaper I would have bought it already.

### Tips

* If you can think of a word, just play it even if it can't fit. You'll get a free letter.
* On especially tricky puzzles, you might want to avoid playing a correct word if it uses up a letter. For example, if a word uses the last `F`, you can no longer make incorrect guesses with `F`.
* Make sure to pay attention to the number of each letter available. If there's already an `F` in an unfinished word around the edge, and there is only one `F` available, it can't be used anywhere else!
