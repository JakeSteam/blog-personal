intro

## #1: [Railbound](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Afterburn.Railbound)

Railbound is a simple logic puzzle concept with a train track-laying aesthetic, from the developers of Golf Peaks and [inbento](/sept-android-game-reviews/#3-inbento). It's tricky!

### Review

The first few levels of Railbound are misleading. Lay some track connecting a train cart to the train's engine, how could this ever get tricky!? Well, tunnels, junctions, multiple carts, signals, and much more quickly complicate things.

Each level has a limited number of track tiles to lay, and there's no energy / cost to trying out new ideas. As such, you're just left to solve the puzzle with no distractions, with a lot of complexity coming from no manual control over the cars, and their requirement to arrive in order. Ideal setup for a puzzle game!

I'm around 30-40 levels in, finishing up world 3 of 13, and I'm consistently impressed with the challenging yet possible design of every single puzzle. It's very rare that a puzzle game does such a good job of drip-feeding new ideas and techniques without any words, and instead relies on you experimenting and building upon your own knowledge.

Additionally, the game has a "core" path of mandatory levels, but at least as many bonus levels too, any of which can be played after completing the corresponding core level. There's no incentive or benefit to solving these puzzles, but it's a great way to reinforce the lessons learned, and solve significantly trickier problems.

For example, Puzzle 2-6A (picture above) appears simple when the non-movable tiles are initially shown (tiles with thick brown wood): just send car 1 through the red tunnel, then route car 2 through the same tunnel to follow afterwards. Except, huh, you've got _one_ tile too few to do this, no matter how cleverly you lay the track. I got stuck here for a while, until I eventually solved it through trial-and-error, and the solution may not be obvious even if you see it!

The solution is to let car 1 go through the red tunnel to the engine, easy. Meanwhile, car 2 needs to go through the blue tunnel, into the red tunnel, follow the looped track, then back through the red tunnel to the engine. When I figured this out I felt very proud, pressed play, and my 2 cars promptly crashed in the post-tunnel junction. The solution? A tactical wiggle for car 2 to ensure it arrives at the junction a little later!

This example should highlight how a well-designed simple puzzle can be deeply engaging to solve, and this is reinforced by the overall player-friendliness of the game. In addition to the expected audio & language controls, there are:

- Quality settings (all seem identical to me, it's a stylised game!)
- Game UI scaling
- Option to unlock all levels
- Option to enable a hint system
- Option to turn on colourblind assistance (e.g. icons for paired tunnels)
- Option to reduce motion effects

### Monetisation

Included in Google Play Pass, or £4.29 (~$6).

### Tips

- You'll definitely get stuck on puzzles, I find completely clearing all tiles and trying something that won't work helps me get to the solution.
- You can increase train speed during playback, you might as well use max speed as you can't edit anything whilst the cars are moving.
- The game is also available (and well reviewed!) [on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1967510/Railbound/), where it seems to include a level creator.
- There is a [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/afterburn) server for the game.
