intro

The games are in descending order of "fun", and might contain mild spoilers:

## #1: [inbento](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Afterburn.Inbento)

Inbento is a very, very cute logic game. It was recommended to me as part of Google Play Pass, and the difficulty ramps up more than expected!

### Review

Whilst the cute cat-themed visuals *did* draw me in somewhat, I was more drawn in by the bento box filling gameplay. The game does an excellent job of guiding you in learning how new pieces work, and the complexity very steadily increases. 

For example, you spend the first few levels just placing overlapping "blocks" in the correct order. Just as you're starting to feel confident, the game throws "swap" tiles into the mix! A few levels later, "move" tiles are added, and this progression really helps draw you in. Additionally, due to the knowledge that every level is building up your skills, every completed level really feels like a success, and not just incrementing a "levels completed" count.

Every 9 levels, there is a very cutesy swipeable mini-comic about the game's characters. These are completely optional, and realistically doesn't improve my gameplay experience (but also doesn't hinder it!). This definitely isn't a game where levels can be casually completed, at least not after the first couple of worlds, but the thoughtful staring is always worth it when the level complete animation is seen. 

There are 127 puzzles across 14 worlds, so far I'm around an hour in with 34 completed. Due to the difficulty ramping up, I suspect each puzzle pack takes 2-3x as long as the one before it.

### Monetisation

I got this free on Google Play Pass, otherwise it would be $2.99. With no adverts or in-app purchases this feels a fair price for a polished and thoughtful puzzle experience.

### Tips

Honestly the game's tutorial is so well executed that I'm not sure I have many tips!

* When a bento box has only 1 of a tile type, that is a guarantee of where that block will go. This lets you plan your other pieces around it. For example in the screenshot below, I know the green tile HAS to go on the right middle, so I can use that as a starting point.
* I sometimes found just placing the blocks down in a naive way got me halfway there, then iterating on this attempt got me to the actual solution.

## Update on previous games

I'm trying something new with this post, and giving a little conclusion on whether I'm still enjoying [games from my previous post](/august-sept-android-game-reviews/), since longevity is important!

### Casting Away

**Uninstalled at level 23.**

This got too grind-y in the late game. Whilst earning money and experience was very easy using the techniques mentioned in my post, it's all a bit pointless. Realistically each run is identical, and there are no surprises after 4-5 hours of gameplay.

### Inventory Idle

**Uninstalled at around 20B/sec.**

I knew this didn't have longevity (as it was a beta), and uninstalled it before writing the previous post. Unfortunately there just wasn't enough depth to make it a long term game.

### Griddie Islands

**Uninstalled at level 37, 5.55T/s.**

Whilst I enjoyed the Tetris gimmick, that's all the game really has to offer. I didn't see *any* new features since around level 10, and no sign of the "level loop" hinted at in the achievements. Additionally, it had annoyances like popping all my achievements again when opened, unexpectedly playing music, intermittent ad availability, etc.

### Fill-a-pix

**Uninstalled with first 2-3 packs completed.**

This was a real shame. As mentioned in my review, whilst I enjoy the gameplay the sheer quantity of purchasable level packs makes it unappealing. Additionally, there's no... point to completing them. 

I discovered the great "assistant" feature after my last review, which helps find errors & shows you the logic behind your next move. This helped me play it longer than the other games reviewed, but was not quite enough.
