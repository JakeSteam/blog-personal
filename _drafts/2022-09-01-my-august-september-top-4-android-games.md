How has it been 4 months since my last Android game round-up post!? Well, here's what I've been playing most in Aug / Sep / Oct / Nov, and yes, they're almost all idle games. Oops.

The games are in descending order of "fun", and might contain mild spoilers:

## #1: Farm & Mine - [Download](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.airapport.farm.mine.idle.ludumdare48)

Farm & Mine was another game I found via [the Ukrainian dev's posts on r/incremental_games](https://www.reddit.com/user/GeneralVimes/submitted/). The concept is pretty simple, build up a little settlement whilst optimising where you use your resources. It contains elements of supply chain management, as well as the usual grinding for coins and resources.

### Review

Whilst a little unpolished and unbalanced, the core gameplay of building up a little city is deeply satisfying. I found myself genuinely interested in what a new building / expansion would look like, an interesting side effect of the game having little explanatory text. The game doesn't offer any advice on how to progress quicker, when to prestige, what industries to focus on, and is instead just provides the environment for you to figure it out yourself.

This kind of gameplay won't work for everyone, but if you can get past the first 10 minutes of confusion, it definitely makes for a far more engaging game. I also like the weekly codes given out on their Discord server, and the ability to share screenshots directly into the server via a bot. Despite being a very small community, emphasising the Discord server so heavily helps it at least have some kind of focus point.

### Monetisation

Luckily, the game is undoubtedly balanced around *not* paying for any upgrades (or "Artifacts"), and they're completely optional. They're even hidden away well enough that I only found them a few hours in.

However, watching the occasional advert is pretty much required to play the game sensibly, as it halves the price of any upgrade / purchase. At the later stages an upgrade can easily take a day's offline earnings to purchase, so halving this price by watching an advert is a no-brainer!
