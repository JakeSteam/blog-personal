I'm inventing a new term, right now: "shitshow comedy". It's my favourite form of entertainment, but I always struggle even defining it let alone finding new examples of it. This article is my attempt to explain it, provide some favourite examples, and help anyone else who has the same taste in comedy.

## What is "shitshow comedy"?

Shitshow comedy is comedy that isn't scripted, isn't predictable, isn't driven by financial gain, and is a non-stop inexplicable car crash throughout. It's not "absurdist", "random", "fringe", or "zoomer humour", but the shitshow has elements from all of them. It can be unintentional or intentional.

It can be a podcast, a video, a livestream, it can even be a game. It can be a few seconds or a few hours. It can be a one-off, a series, or even an entire career, but when you see it you'll know.

The appeal is hard to define, there are no jokes or slapstick comedy. And yet... it's undeniably funny. Here's an example that is a one-off, short, unintentional video, courtesy of DJ Akademiks:

## What's the appeal?

### Noncommercial

Shitshow comedy is rarely directly sponsored or profitable. There's no product to sell, no catchy marketing phrase, it's just a mess that is usually ad supported. The restrictions that come with commercialised comedy stifle shitshow comedy too much, forcing it to follow a script, a timeline, or family-friendly language.

The internet has been a blessing for this form of comedy, letting individuals or groups who could never receive traditional funding suddenly find an audience via YouTube / Twitch, and get paid. Services like Patreon also free them from worrying about their content appealing to a wide audience for profitability reasons, and just... let them be funny.

This makes shitshow comedy a much-needed relief from the all too common sales-pitch-during-comedy structure.

### Unpredictable

Unpredictability is *the* single biggest identifier of shitshow comedy. Not just unpredictability in terms of what will be said or what will happen, but on a meta level too. Will the Twitch stream break and end without any explanation? Will the game experience a bizarre bug? Will it all go smoothly and be boring? Anything is possible!

Additionally, all of the disaster / mess isn't affecting others, it's just self-contained chaos. 

### Comfy

Despite not knowing what will happen next, there is an element of "comfiness" to shitshow comedy. This applies most to people like Jerma who do lengthy livestreams, by knowing the content creator's personality even previously unwatched videos are somewhat familiar. 

This trait along with the next makes a lot of shitshow content perfect both for dedicated watching, and having on in the background. 

### Social

With group content between long-standing content creators like Triforce or Hatfilms, their dynamics are a known quantity. Each has a niche to fill, whilst the words in their interactions are always changing, the overall theme of the conversation has been performed a hundred times before.

## Examples

Okay, finally onto probably the most useful part of this post: examples of shitshow comedy. 

### YouTube / Twitch

| Creator | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| **Jerma985**<br>*[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@Jerma985) / [YouTube 2](https://www.youtube.com/@2ndJerma) / [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/jerma985)*<br>By far my favourite content creator, undeniably the most creative person I've ever seen, the "[anti-streamer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v80fUUqmOgE)". It's impossible to pick a single example, anyone with any interest in shitshow comedy will know and love him. | {::nomarkdown}<ul><li>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vHx9IvyoV4">Jerma Animated - Clip it, Quick!</a>" (2018, 4:14)</li><li>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWRf2WAZuoc">Jerma's Social Anxiety</a>" (2022, 0:50)</li><li>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43JXQ3_8gmI">Jerma exposed by candid camera</a>" (2018, 0:26)</li><li>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfBcz_4XOaA">Jerma's Wrestling Empire</a>" (2021, 27:54)</li></ul>{:/} |
| **Dafnotdaff**<br>*[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/dafnotdaff)*<br>Probably the least consistently live creator on this list, since he has an actual job at Yogscast (seemingly sorting... everything). However his streams are consistently all over the place. Bad camera, bad audio, disruptive bit incentives, it's got everything you could ask for. | {::nomarkdown}<ul><li>"<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/dafnotdaff/clip/BetterScaryGaurM4xHeh-6RAjrI0SyWd3Sm4F">TESCO MEAL DEAL SPEEDRUN - WORLD RECORD?</a> (2022, 0:58)</li><li><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/dafnotdaff/clip/PoorUnsightlyKangarooOSfrog-2S7MtHKMlxz2KXlA">mc daf</a> (2022, 0:60)</li><li><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/dafnotdaff/clip/CoyFurryPlumageNerfBlueBlaster-7NF98AkcRjClF5Sx">clip</a> (2022, 0:15)</li></ul>{:/} |

## What're the drawbacks?

Okay, so if shitshow comedy seemingly doesn't require much preparation or scripting, and just requires putting funny people in scenarios where things can go wrong, why isn't it everywhere?

### Hard to find

What do all the content creators listed earlier have in common? Ultimately, not much.

Because of this, it's hard to find new examples besides stumbling upon them randomly or having them personally recommended to you. They're unlikely to be doing big partnerships with large financial backing, so will just be fumbling around in a weird game category. 

### Hard to grow

### Hard to monetise
