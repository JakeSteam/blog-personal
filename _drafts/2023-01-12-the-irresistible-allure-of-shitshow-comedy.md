I'm inventing a new term, right now: "shitshow comedy". It's my favourite form of entertainment, but I always struggle even defining it let alone finding new examples of it. This article is my attempt to explain it, provide some favourite examples, and help anyone else who has the same taste in comedy.

## What is "shitshow comedy"?

Shitshow comedy is comedy that isn't scripted, isn't predictable, isn't driven by financial gain, and is a non-stop inexplicable car crash throughout. It's not "absurdist", "random", "fringe", or "zoomer humour", but the shitshow has elements from all of them. It can be unintentional or intentional.

It can be a podcast, a video, a livestream, it can even be a game. It can be a few seconds or a few hours. It can be a one-off, a series, or even an entire career, but when you see it you'll know.

The appeal is hard to define, there are no jokes or slapstick comedy. And yet... it's undeniably funny. Here's an example that is a one-off, short, unintentional video, courtesy of DJ Akademiks:

## What's the appeal?

### Noncommercial

Shitshow comedy is rarely directly sponsored or profitable. There's no product to sell, no catchy marketing phrase, it's just a mess that is usually ad supported. The restrictions that come with commercialised comedy stifle shitshow comedy too much, forcing it to follow a script, a timeline, or family-friendly language.

The internet has been a blessing for this form of comedy, letting individuals or groups who could never receive traditional funding suddenly find an audience via YouTube / Twitch, and get paid. Services like Patreon also free them from worrying about their content appealing to a wide audience for profitability reasons, and just... let them be funny.

This makes shitshow comedy a much-needed relief from the all too common sales-pitch-during-comedy structure.

### Unpredictable

Unpredictability is *the* single biggest identifier of shitshow comedy. Not just unpredictability in terms of what will be said or what will happen, but on a meta level too. Will the Twitch stream break and end without any explanation? Will the game experience a bizarre bug? Will it all go smoothly and be boring? Anything is possible!

Additionally, all of the disaster / mess isn't affecting others, it's just self-contained chaos. 

### Comfy

Despite not knowing what will happen next, there is an element of "comfiness" to shitshow comedy. This applies most to people like Jerma who do lengthy livestreams, by knowing the content creator's personality even previously unwatched videos are somewhat familiar. 

This trait along with the next makes a lot of shitshow content perfect both for dedicated watching, and having on in the background. 

### Social

With group content between long-standing content creators like Triforce or Hatfilms, their dynamics are a known quantity. Each has a niche to fill, whilst the words in their interactions are always changing, the overall theme of the conversation has been performed a hundred times before.

## Examples

Okay, finally onto probably the most useful part of this post: examples of shitshow comedy. 

### YouTube / Twitch

Whilst most shitshow comedy creators these days are on Twitch, YouTube was historically a much better place to find their work.

Twitch has the real-time aspect, meaning there's a lot more scope for unpredictability, however a lot of streams have constant interactions with chat / donators. This keeps them somewhat grounded in reality, and stops them from getting too "into" anything with shitshow potential.

YouTube on the other hand requires recording, editing, and uploading the content. Considering how often shitshow comedy interferes with the technical elements (e.g. PC breaking, internet dying, files corrupted), the scope of disaster is limited. However, since a creator can spend hours playing a game without any interruptions, they can get much deeper into the disaster. 

The best shitshow comedians can handle both. For example, Jerma's infamous "[Grab That Auto 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU6WC4dpaHM)" wouldn't have worked as well if it was a stream, since half the appeal is Jerma getting lost in the insanity of the game. Similarly, the "[700,000 MORE* Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-ZNrUohxEI&)" stream wouldn't have worked as a video. The accidental self-slap, clickmaps, and chat helping hunt for witch image assets are a core part. 

| Creator | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| **Jerma985**<br>*[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@Jerma985) / [YouTube 2](https://www.youtube.com/@2ndJerma) / [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/jerma985)*<br>By far my favourite content creator, undeniably the most creative person I've ever seen, the "[anti-streamer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v80fUUqmOgE)". It's impossible to pick a single example, anyone with any interest in shitshow comedy will know and love him. | {::nomarkdown}<ul><li>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vHx9IvyoV4">Jerma Animated - Clip it, Quick!</a>" (2018, 4:14)</li><li>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWRf2WAZuoc">Jerma's Social Anxiety</a>" (2022, 0:50)</li><li>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43JXQ3_8gmI">Jerma exposed by candid camera</a>" (2018, 0:26)</li><li>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfBcz_4XOaA">Jerma's Wrestling Empire</a>" (2021, 27:54)</li></ul>{:/} |
| **Dafnotdaff**<br>*[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/dafnotdaff)*<br>Probably the least consistently live & most unknown creator on this list, since he also has an actual job at Yogscast (seemingly sorting... everything). However his streams are consistently all over the place. Bad camera, bad audio, disruptive bit donation incentives, it's got everything you could ask for. | {::nomarkdown}<ul><li>"<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/dafnotdaff/clip/BetterScaryGaurM4xHeh-6RAjrI0SyWd3Sm4F">TESCO MEAL DEAL SPEEDRUN - WORLD RECORD?</a>" (2022, 0:58)</li><li>"<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/dafnotdaff/clip/PoorUnsightlyKangarooOSfrog-2S7MtHKMlxz2KXlA">mc daf</a>" (2022, 0:60)</li><li>"<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/dafnotdaff/clip/CoyFurryPlumageNerfBlueBlaster-7NF98AkcRjClF5Sx">clip</a>" (2022, 0:15)</li></ul>{:/} |
| **Yogscast**<br>*[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@yogscast) / [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/yogscast)*<br>The Yogscast are a group of 30+ people these days, so there's not actually *that* much fully shitshow comedy left in their main videos (besides [Lewis](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitLewisSays/top/) of course). However, in the early days of the channel (and group), it was a chaotic mess. The intentionally independent yet collaborating nature of the group's individuals lets new shitshow comedy emerge (e.g. Dafnotdaff) whilst also having the support structure they need (e.g. legal services, office space). | {::nomarkdown}<ul><li>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ohslGivm8">Voltz Special - Episode 12 - The Bomb</a>" (2013, 34:59)</li><li>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJuTOBv77uA">WHAT?SEEDS?DUNCAN!</a>" (2017, 1:28)</li><li>"<a href="https://clips.twitch.tv/PolishedVibrantFerretYouDontSay-Fnv0ku9SlJPMIWLI">What's your job?</a>" (2022, 0:05)</li></ul>{:/} |
| **itswill**<br>*[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@williesuede) / [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/itswill)*<br>Whilst technically a RuneScape streamer, Will's Friday variety streams are some of the best shitshow comedy I've seen. Maybe it's just because the variety games are a break from his hundred-hour grinds on RuneScape, but he brings an amazing sense of humour to every game he touches, regardless of quality. | {::nomarkdown} <ul><li>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGcw-XtNRQ">I played Runescape with Soulja Boy</a>" (2020, 11:22)</li><li>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HM0u1sBkqkE">Runescapes Biggest Threat: Genfanad</a>" (2022, 16:44)</li><li>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHXA472WdQc">How I was the REAL winner of the $32k DMM Finals</a>" (2021, 18:54)</li></ul> |
| **Hatfilms**<br>*[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@hatfilms) / [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/hatfilms)*<br>Whilst Hatfilms are Yogscast affiliated, they usually keep to themselves as a trio. A mixture of IRL and gaming content, their content varies from relatively slick to shitshow, usually depending on the game. | {::nomarkdown}<ul><li>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ohslGivm8">You may have condemned me gentlemen, but I will have my 75 seconds</a>" (2021, 0:59)</li><li>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnfSIieuNyI&list=PLzVj8R5yaQQ-w0Gg9H4jmvSwvkClpI7w4&index=2">Hat Films Improv Song Compilation</a>" (2015, 24:27)</li><li>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y43o_VvoDRQ">PANCAKE CHAINSAW MASSACRE!</a>" (2017, 13:33)</a></li></ul>{:/} |

## What're the drawbacks?

Okay, so if shitshow comedy seemingly doesn't require much preparation or scripting, and just requires putting funny people in scenarios where things can go wrong, why isn't it everywhere?

### Hard to find

What do all the content creators listed earlier have in common? Ultimately, not much.

Because of this, it's hard to find new examples besides stumbling upon them randomly or having them personally recommended to you. They're unlikely to be doing big partnerships with large financial backing, so will just be fumbling around in a weird game category. 

### Hard to grow

### Hard to monetise
