At the end of 2023, I spent a couple of weeks in Central Europe. The last of the 4 major cities visited was Berlin, where I spent 4ish days. Here's the major things I got up to! 

In total, I was in Berlin from the afternoon of Tue 27th December to just after lunch on Sat 30th.

*Note: This is part 4 of 4 from this trip: [Zurich](/zurich-reviews), [Vienna](/vienna-reviews), [Prague](/prague-reviews), and **Berlin**.*

## Day 1 (26th December): Arrival

We arrived a little later than expected, so our first day was just the usual "hotel and food". We were getting a little hangry so made a lazy choice for dinner, oops! We had **10,151 steps (4.05 miles) walked**, mostly from before we arrived in Berlin.

### Steigenberger Hotel am Kanzleramt ★★★★✰

This hotel has a great location, being approx 100 metres from one of the two exits from Berlin main station! This makes it easy to get trams or trains to anywhere else, or walk into Berlin centre via the Reichstag.

The room itself was pretty standard, however we very lucky to have one of the few rooms that can see the sunrise over the Reichstag! This was a completely unexpected surprise, and provided a great view every morning. 

Unfortunately, being high up facing the sunrise had the disadvantage that the gym was directly above us. This meant hearing weights being dropped, or the repetitive noises of a treadmill, at all hours of the day. Particularly obnoxious was the ~8am run another guest clearly did, waking us up most days. Whilst we usually do a hotel breakfast, the 29 euros each made it a non-starter, and it seems surprisingly high considering there are nearby cafes and restaurants.

Overall a pretty standard large hotel experience.

### Hans im Glück ★★★★✰

We popped in here for a quick meal since it was one of the few places open quite late. Whilst the food and drink was pretty good, although a little expensive, the service was a bit of a problem. 

Our food arrived without cutlery, tissues, etc, and I had to grab them from a nearby table. Similarly, getting the waitress' attention to order, get the bill etc was quite tricky. This might have been due to our seating location near the windows, the other side from most of the larger tables.

I had their festive special burger which was... unique. Good, I think, but unique! Their Berliner Weisse (raspberry) was an unusual experience too, but one of the few places I saw this traditional drink offered.

## Day 2 (27th December): Historical

Google Maps seem to have had quite poor tracking, but this was a quite heavily planned day where we walked in a large `b` shape to cover all the main historical landmarks. We got a surprisingly fast train back from Potsdamer Platz, taking a total of 2 minutes!

This route resulted in **14,468 steps (6.41 miles) walked**.

### Tucano Cafe ★★★★★

We initially visited this cafe since it was closest to our hotel, but enjoyed it so much we ended up visiting almost every morning!

Whilst the menu is somewhat limited, every item on there is excellent. All of it can also be taken away to eat in the nearby park, even trickier meals like pancakes or porridge. Staff were friendly and helpful, and it had a relaxed atmosphere.

I highly recommend the "Hippie Cookie", a nutty chewy flapjack-y thing that we ended up buying to take with us on walks. Additionally, the chicken wrap is simple but excellent. Careful when eating it since the dressing has a tendency to drip out towards the end!

### Spreebokgenpark ★★★★★

A great park to walk through on your way between the train station and other areas, or eat breakfast on one of the many benches. There's often musicians playing, and eating breakfast whilst watching the sunrise and listening to jazz was a lovely experience.

Even at nighttime it is quite populated and well lit, giving a safe feeling. There is also a great riverside walk cutting through it, worth taking if you have the time.

### Murdered Jews Memorial ★★★★★

Obviously it's hard to review a memorial objectively. However, this was an excellent two-part structure, and a highly recommend taking the time to experience both parts.

The upper part, the rectangular slabs, is a unique experience. Whilst the outer blocks feel like a collection of obstacles, the ground dips towards the middle resulting in a surreal experience somewhat similar to a very claustrophobic forest. There are often a few children running around (and into!) the blocks, but I highly recommend walking slowly and making a little noise with your feet to avoid any collisions.

The underground part, the exhibition, is absolutely wort

## Day 3 (28th December): Sachsenhausen

We took a day trip to the nearby former concentration camp Sachsenhausen, in Oranienburg. Despite taking a train to the town, a walk at each end and plenty of walking within the camp meant **17,608 steps (7.83 miles) walked**.

### Sachsenhausen etc ★★★★★

### Bavaria ★★★★★

## Day 4 (29th December): East

This day was pretty relaxed, walking the full length of Unter den Linden and getting the train back. Since we were looking at shops etc on the way, only **11,057 steps (4.39 miles) walked**.

## Day 5 (30th December): Tiergarten & Departure

This was *meant* to be a chill day, not sure how we ended up with **19,557 steps (7.65 miles) walked**! We explored Tiergarten and did a bit of shopping at the other side of it, before getting the train back to our hotel then the airport.
