intro

_Note: This is a series of posts, with Tokyo [Part 1](/japan-part-1-tokyo/), Takayama Part 2 (this article), Kyoto [Part 3](/japan-part-3-kyoto/), and Tokyo [Part 4](/japan-part-4-tokyo/)._

## Day 1 (27th August): Arrival

We travelled in from Tokyo (via Toyama), and luckily had plenty of time to explore the historical old town streets we were planning to look at the next day! This resulted in a healthy **9,174 steps (4.15 miles)**.

### Oyado Koto No Yume ★★★★★

This traditional hotel in a great location was such a unique experience! Despite being affordable, guests are treated as honoured visitors, with services offered by default that go far beyond what I've experienced elsewhere.

For example, upon check-in we received a detailed room tour by staff, along with free sake in the evening. The options whilst checking in can be a little overwhelming, as the traditional nature means staff will tidy away your beds during lunchtime, then lay them back out again in the evening. Luckily we were out all day so just opted for the single visit (and beds always out), but if you intend to spend lots of time in the hotel be aware of this!

Similarly, upon entering you need to hand your shoes to a staff member in exchange for your key, and reverse the process every time you leave. Whilst this "being waited on" experience is presumably attractive, it disincentivises brief rest stops in your hotel room since it'll take quite a bit of yours & employees time!

Breakfast is unbelievably high quality, with reserved tables and your meal brought to you upon entering. The Japanese and Western meals vary daily (one example of each in photos), with a staggering array of different foods in each one! The Japanese one is (unsurprisingly) slightly better, but either will absolutely fill you up and leave you feeling like royalty. There's the usual hot drink / cereal / pastries available, but these foods are rarely touched. Additionally, only some guests use the provided clothing (0-30% per day), but it is of course fine either way.

The rooms themselves are a little outdated, with plug sockets a bit far away, bathing experience a little disjointed, and minor wear and tear on the rooms. They're perfectly usable though, and the staff redeem them entirely by adding little snacks to your room daily, along with ice cold water! Coming home to these after a day out was a wonderful experience.

Finally, there's a surprisingly high quality shop in the lobby, offering many of the same products sold within the market. We bought some small gifts and magnets here, it's a much appreciated feature. There's also a small gift on checkout to remember your trip by, keep an eye out!

### Wooden beckoning cat ★★★★★

It's a wooden beckoning cat.

### Hidatakayama Town Museum ★★★★✰

This museum is entirely free, and somewhat hidden away. Upon entering, collecting a free map will guide you around the ~10 exhibition rooms and few small gardens. There's lots of well written information about the town's history and traditions, most of it in English.

When we visited there did not seem to be any staff around, despite the clearly well maintained grounds. Regardless of your interest in the local history, there's enough peaceful places to rest quietly to make this worth a visit.

### Chan-no-me cafe ★★★★✰

Very tasty little filled pastries, only accepts cash and the often busy nature can make it tricky to order. There's a surprisingly large and quiet eating area at the back, highly recommend it instead of standing in the street.

### MUGI ★★★★★

We ended up eating here due to all other restaurants nearby being closed late at night or having long tourist queues, and we're so so glad!

This was one of our best eating experiences in Japan, with the friendly chef making a wide variety of food in the surprisingly small cooking area. Everything we had was excellent, with the potato mochi special being a highlight. Sake portions were generous (and strong!), and the open sides let the outside ambience in whilst still feeling intimate.

We stayed for an hour or so, with the small izakaya being around half full throughout.

### SAN AI Japanese Art Culture ★★★★★

Despite plenty of souvenir shops along the old town streets, SAN AI manages to include the simpler, more obvious items alongside many exclusive products created in collaboration with Japanese artists. We bought a couple of things from our multiple visits here, it's a great place for gifts.

### Kaji Bridge

Busy bridge with shops on both sides, plus a good view downriver. It's also possible to sit on the waterside and watch the foot traffic.

### Ikada Bridge

Convenient bridge to get into the old town, plus excellent views of Nakabashi Bridge at night!

### Gyojin Bridge

Small convenient bridge to get between the two halves of the town, far quieter than any others. A nice riverside seat too.
