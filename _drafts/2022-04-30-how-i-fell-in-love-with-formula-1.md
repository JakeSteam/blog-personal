I've spent my entire life disliking sports. Hated doing them at school, couldn't care less when they were on TV, didn't see the appeal whatsoever, and at 29 I assumed the appeal was never going to "click". That was until... Formula 1 became an obsession ~12 months ago. But why?

When I was younger, I vaguely remember a routine of my dad watching painfully dull sports on a Sunday afternoon and falling asleep. Snooker, Formula 1, golf, it all seemed pretty much the same thing: background TV to doze off to. As such, I completely ignored anything F1 related, just like football or rugby.

That was until a year or so ago, when it suddenly exploded in my consciousness. I'm genuinely curious where the interest came from, so decided to track it down before F1 became too ingrained to remember the before times!

As far as I can tell, it was a 3-pronged attack: Engineering, Entertainment, and Gaming.

## Engineering

As a software engineer who has used computers heavily their whole life, I've always cared about software. I've also always had a tangential interest in hardware, from building a few computers to taking devices apart to see how they work. I think this interest, and how it applies to an interest in Formula 1, can be considered a direct progression:

### Step 1: LEGO

As a kid, just like... pretty much everyone I knew, I spent hundreds of hours with LEGO. This instilled an instinctive interest in how things work and improving designs.

### Step 2: Physics

Perhaps because of this, I've always been fascinated by the physics of materials, of interactions, etc. This is why I enjoy things like [LockPickingLawyer](https://www.youtube.com/c/lockpickinglawyer), [post 10](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsCNU-ptlze2tqAJSDeVGNQ), [bigcliveddotcom](https://www.youtube.com/c/Bigclive) and [Hydraulic Press Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/HydraulicPressChannel) among many others. 

This all became relevant when I realised how crucial tyre wear, aerodynamics, and materials used were to every Formula 1 race, and that it was essentially a giant applied physics lesson.

### Step 3: Engines

Despite not having any interest in owning a car, and exclusively using public transport, I *do* care about engines and self-driving cars. The conversion from one energy type to another (e.g. chemical energy into mechanical energy + heat in a combustion engine) is a truly fascinating topic. This ties back into the first "stepping stone" when considering LEGO sets like the [Land Rover Defender](https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/land-rover-defender-42110), with a fairly detailed engine that I built recently:

Putting this together definitely made some of the engine-related lessons learned from [James Bruton](https://www.youtube.com/c/jamesbruton), [Driven Media](https://www.youtube.com/c/DrivenMedia/), [The Engineers Post](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheEngineersPost), and [Superfastmatt](https://www.youtube.com/c/SuperfastMatt) more tangible. Having a basic understanding of engines also helped me appreciate the genius and hard work that goes into all car creation, but especially pioneering cars like Teslas and Formula 1.

On the topic of Tesla, regardless of the failings of Elon / Tesla, from an engineering perspective their gigafactories are absolutely astonishing. They are the "machine that makes the machine", and feel like the engineering future games like Portal prepared us for. Here's a drone flythrough:

### Step 4: Space

I won't go into my interest in space too much (it could easily be an endless series of posts...), but I've followed the engineering behind Falcon 9 and Starship among other rockets, as documented by [Everyday Astronaut](https://www.youtube.com/c/EverydayAstronaut), [Scott Manley](https://www.youtube.com/c/szyzyg), [NASA Spaceflight](https://www.youtube.com/c/NASASpaceflightVideos), [Marcus House](https://www.youtube.com/c/MarcusHouse) and countless others for years.

There's a lot of obvious similarities between rockets and cars, with the main difference being one moves mainly horizontally and one vertically! Okay *maybe* there's a few more differences, but the core concepts of pushing engines and aerodynamics to their absolute limit and breaking new ground definitely heavily overlap. 

Both also require an astronomical amount of money and demand complete reliability at every millisecond, whilst fusing together hardware and software to control technology too advanced for a single driver / pilot. Many astronauts and F1 drivers have died in the pursuit of speed and reliability, but when it works the frisson is undeniable. 

This has been one of my favourite videos since release, and I can't help but revisit it occasionally as an almost perfect visualisation of human effort creating technological brilliance:

### Step 5: Formula 1

So how does a broad interest in engineering translate into an interest in Formula 1?

Well, if [changing 4 tyres safely in 1.82 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsCriICZ-nA) isn't a pinnacle of human skill + engineering, I don't know what is! Except maybe doing similar times back to back....

The engineering expertise that went into making something like that possible, whilst also creating cars that can drive absurdly fast laps around tight city streets like Monaco is honestly staggering.
