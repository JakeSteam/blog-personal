intro

For this post I'm trialling moving screenshots above the wall-of-text review. Seeing the game before reading me yapping about it might make a better sales pitch!

## #1: [TED Tumblewords](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.NGP.WordsbyTED)

TED's Tumblewords, free with Netflix, might be my favourite word game of all time. No timers, no adverts, just solid spelling gameplay.

### Screenshots

All screenshots are from version 1.1.1:

### Review

I've reviewed a [few of Netflix's games before](/android-games-netflix/), and recently took another look at their Developer page on Google Play. For some reason, there are plenty of games there that _aren't_ listed within the Netflix app itself! One of these is TED Tumblewords. The gameplay has some similarities to [Word Salad](/android-games-june-2024/#1-word-salad), but instead of being a puzzle with a solution, it's a 1v1 turn-based game with many answers.

The goal of each level (regardless of which game mode, or whether you're playing a real person or a bot) is to spell high value words by connecting the letters within a 2x3 / 3x3 grid. There are a few complexities, such as some letters providing bonus points (yellow), and starting your word with the last letter of your opponent's word giving a massive 100 point bonus.

However, you're primarily always going to be trying to see long, high value words. Earlier on in the game, the 100 point bonus for using the correct first letter will be essential, but when you're hitting 300+ a word it's merely a suggestion.

You can "shift" a limited number of rows or columns per round, letting you line up better words. This can be a little mind-melting, especially when trying to shift letters to spell a particularly long word! Luckily even when you're out of shifts, you can "shuffle" the entire board. I admit there's been a couple of occasions where I've had to tap shuffle 50+ times until I get a lucky layout that lets me spell an excellent word!

Whilst "connect letters to spell words" isn't anything new, it's presented in a smooth, engaging, and enjoyable package. For example, whilst player vs player is available (more on that later!), the core of the game is a single player campaign. TED's educational influence runs throughout, with 10 "Topics" (e.g. Business & Economics), each consisting of 3 "Packs" (e.g. "Stock Market") with 10 levels of 3-6 rounds each. This gives a total of around 300 core levels, with each topic having a different colour scheme and opponent.

Each of these levels is realistically pretty similar, although the opponent AI difficulty will differ. The easier AIs will be beatable with minimal thought, whilst the most difficult might take a couple of tries. Somewhat sneakily, each level has a fixed set of letters, so if you get crushed by an amazing word from the AI, you can use it against them when you try again!

The gameplay itself is enough of an incentive to work through the campaign, however there is a reward I absolutely love: A related fact is shown upon completion. These facts are genuinely interesting, and almost all have been new information to me. Completing all the levels in a Pack rewards a new player badge, a purely visual change.

So, a core campaign with a few hundred levels of solid, relaxed word-based gameplay. Is that it? Nope! There are a few additional gamemodes, each of which has a new level every day (plus the usual streak indicators). These are:

1. "Daily Match": A standard match against the AI opponent.
2. "Daily Six": You play 6 words by yourself, aiming for the highest score.
3. "Daily Ladder": You play as many words as you can, aiming for the highest possible total score.

I'm not particularly into daily games, but these 3 do a great job of ensuring there's a bit of variety. Additionally, every past level is playable at any time, avoiding any fear of missing out. In fact, each 2-week period also has a unique player badge if all Daily Matches are completed, so I'm intending to work my way backwards until the very first (July 2024).

The ability to play past daily levels freely is a small thing, but indicative of the entire game. Everything seems designed to let you have a _fun_ time, instead of trying to make you pay, get you addicted, etc. Little things like different AI character designs for different topics, or Santa when playing Daily Matches from Christmas, make it a game I actively want to play.

Finally, there's Player vs Player. I'm usually strongly averse to competitive gameplay, but in this case it's still turn-based and still follows the same rules as the main game, so it's really just a more challenging gameplay experience. Since each player can take as long as they want, a 4 round game can take 10 minutes or 10 days. Luckily, since no context is needed (you can see all the letters), there's no downside to having many games going at once.

There's no interaction between players, so it's necessarily a safe, laid-back experience. In fact, all you can see of your opponent is their name, their player badge, and their current level. Since level is based entirely on your overall XP, this is a good indicator of roughly how good they will be.

I didn't experience any obvious cheating (looking up the best words would be trivial), and it's extremely satisfying playing a far better player 3-4 times in a row and finally getting a win!

### Monetisation

There's none! If you have Netflix, it's entirely free.

### Tips

- Have your word planned before you start shifting the board, as you can only undo 1 shift.
- If you can't see any decent words, try shifting a row or column at random, you might see a new letter combination.
- Some quick mental maths can be useful for the last round, to work out exactly what score you need to beat your opponent. For example, if you're already ahead and it's your last turn, playing any word will win.
- You can exit and resume a level at any time, so don't feel obligated to finish it in one sitting.
- There are 24 achievements, with 3 requiring a 7-day streak. As such, I'd recommend playing all the daily matches for a week to complete them.
- I have a theory that many levels have a single possible 9-letter word. As such, taking a second to see if you can spot it can often win you the game on the very first round.
