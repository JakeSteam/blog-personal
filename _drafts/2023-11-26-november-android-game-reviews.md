intro

The games are in descending order of "fun", and might contain mild spoilers:

## #1: [Idle Game 1](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cem.idle1)

Idle Game 1 (yes, that's really the name) is an idle game that strips away any of the story, objects, or setting, and focuses purely on the prestige loop. 

### Review

I'm unsure how I feel about Idle Game 1. There is definitely a satisfying core to the game, but so, so much of the UI and progression feels like it actively dislikes the players.

For example, the dark colour schemes with coloured highlights is very satisfying. Despite not having any reference point for whether a "layer" is an employee, a machine, a world, who knows, each has a unique feel due to their colour. Similarly, there are minimal animations, but those that are added help remind you the game actually is progressing.

However, the UI seems intentionally designed to be hard to understand. None of the UI elements will make any sense whatsoever when you first open the game. Eventually you will learn which bit of text probably means your "money" per second, which probably means your upgrade cost, etc. There's no tutorial, no help, no guidance, just blundering around wondering what things mean.

I'm a couple of hours in, and sometimes a circle appears in the top left that says "Idle", "Wait", "2m", or has a tick. I think it's something to do with when I can unlock a new layer? I have no idea, nor any way to find out.

The first 20-30 minutes of the game are good, with new (very similar) areas or upgrades unlocked at a decent pace. However, the progression speed hits massive "walls" very early on, where the time required for significant progress will change from a couple of minutes to a day or two.

Besides the baffling UI and the sluggish progression, the prestige loop is ridiculous. You have 9 "layers" (colours), each of which can have their "up arrow" (earnings), "lightning bolt" (speed), or "down arrow" (cost) boosted whwn you prestige. You do *not* get to choose, and instead one will be boosted completely at random. This design choice means most of your prestiges will be totally pointless, and occasionally you'll get lucky and actually boost your most profitable "layer".

I wouldn't mind this randomness if each run actually had some variance. Instead, you will perform identical actions (hold down unlock area button, hold down each area's upgrade button) over and over and *over* again, with no end in sight. Is this fun? Is this good gameplay? Perhaps not.

Looking online to try and find why it has 100k downloads, I found [a Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/U5VBS9JY9R) with 8.7k members and a [somewhat active Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Idle1/). However... people just seem to be discussing how brutal the grind is! It seems like there's another layer or two to the prestiging, but it requires days of offline time.

So why would someone make a game that seems well made, but then suddenly hits massive walls in progression? Those that have been playing mobile games for a while probably know the answer...

### Monetisation

Yep, to make money.

Early on in the game, I was enjoying the progression so spent $1 on a small boost that got me ahead half hour or so. This seemed good value for money, and I was happy to pay it. 

Once you hit a wall however, paying becomes almost mandatory. As an example, I've currently been stuck at the same level for an hour or so (trying to buy "Calculation 5"). The game has a constantly visible prompt to buy an "infinity boost", that would skip me forward an unfathomable amount of time, apparently offering a bonus of... 95,890,000,000,000,000 in anything I want. This completely invalidates the entire grind and gameplay loop.

The expectation seems to be to get me to buy this seemingly "final" boost, whereby I will then hit another wall, eventually give up and buy the next boost, etc etc etc until I have no money left or quit the game. Fun.

### Tips

* Open up the settings and turn "D. Chart" on. This shows your distribution of earnings per layer, and is essential for knowing which layer to prioritise, yet is not on by default.
* I recommend changing "Up modes" to "Sticky" or "On" in the settings, so you have easy access to them.
* I used "xM" (buy to next milestone) for upgrade mode, since the milestones provide such a massive boost.

### Screenshots

Whilst I usually provide 3+ screenshots, this game only really has 1 screen. Here's the main screen, note that the white line at the top is part of the game, I don't know why:
