I listen to a lot of music! However, it's almost entirely hip hop or related genres, and I've completely missed most of the biggest artists' discographies. Time to change that, with the help of a Top 100 list!

Somewhat arbitrarily, I'm using [Billboard's "Greatest of All Time Artists"](https://www.billboard.com/charts/greatest-of-all-time-artists/#) list. It seems to favour older artists with significant impact, which is _good_ for my intention of gaining more awareness of artists in other genres.

For essentially all of these artists, I know their name, could possibly name a single song, but have never intentionally listened to them. Hopefully by listening to their entire discography (up to 10 albums!) I'll gain an acceptable understanding of their style.

Obviously this is a long article, so skip to any artist you enjoy! The notes on each are going to be informal (and usually ill-informed).

## #1: The Beatles

### Expectations

I've listened to the top 2-3 Beatles songs on Spotify out of curiosity before, and enjoy "Yesterday", but otherwise no interaction with their music.

I'm expecting vaguely upbeat pop music, all sounding quite outdated and simple, with the occasional slower / experimental track.

### Review

**7/10**, after listening to 13/13 albums.

Whilst the music started about how I expected, and how I imagined the 1960s, the change in musical style and sheer volume of output over just 7 years is startling. It definitely feels like popular music progressed significantly over this period due to their creative output, and transitioned into tracks (e.g. on Abbey Road) that definitely don't sound like their 1960s release date.

### Notes

- **Spotify mess**: The Beatles albums are such a mess on Spotify. There are all kinds of "Super Deluxe" versions, with 100+ songs ([example](https://open.spotify.com/album/1WMVvswNzB9i2UMh9svso5?si=jqi-lQ3ZTBy7r88Smsngmw)), and even the proper songs & albums all have "Remastered 2009" on them. It's a shame, and the clutter makes it hard to actually listen to the original albums instead of endless cashing in over the years.
- **Early albums**: The first couple of albums couldn't connect to them, all very upbeat and evidently from a different generation, about what I expected.
- **Occasional connection**: From the album "A Hard Day's Night" onwards, I had rare moments of songs feeling more modern, more relatable, able to connect to the emotions (e.g. [And I Love Her](https://open.spotify.com/track/65vdMBskhx3akkG9vQlSH1?si=c623da4550884afe), [Yesterday](https://open.spotify.com/track/3BQHpFgAp4l80e1XslIjNI?si=b7ec634e7e5f405a)).
- **Similarity**: A lot of similar vibes overall in the earlier albums, which is fine, and it makes for reasonable upbeat background music. Neutral, inoffensive, although presumably was groundbreaking at the time.
- **Familiarity**: Recognised a few songs without realising, e.g. "[With A Little Help From My Friends](https://open.spotify.com/track/2RnPATK99oGOZygnD2GTO6?si=ae908ec0fff34b66)", "[Hello Mister Postman](https://open.spotify.com/track/6wfK1R6FoLpmUA9lk5ll4T?si=ec2445e1d9694be7)".
- **Sgt Pepper's**: Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band had more interesting influences, a bit less upbeat, probably my favourite album.
- **Disliked songs**: Strongly dislike "[I Am The Walrus](https://open.spotify.com/track/6Pq9MmkDQYZiiCDpxnvrf6?si=c87b6fe411194731)" on Magical Mystery Tour, nonsensical word salad. Same with "[Revolution 9](https://open.spotify.com/track/5dZ8PeKKZJLIQAWNTdp8WX?si=542dd5a9c4774c1c)" on The White Album, just 8 minutes of repetitive self-indulgent noise (apparently [some members agreed](https://www.the-paulmccartney-project.com/song/revolution-9/#:~:text=McCartney%20had%20been%20out%20of,be%20included%20on%20the%20album.)).
- **Yellow Submarine**: Yellow Submarine's majority instrumentals surprised me, it sounds like a Disney film soundtrack! "[Let It Be](https://open.spotify.com/track/7iN1s7xHE4ifF5povM6A48?si=7396ebdcbe014a55)" also sounded very modern.
