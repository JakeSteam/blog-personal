## Day 1 (20th October): Arrival

After a few delays in our flight, we got into Barcelona in the early evening. Our only objectives were groceries, dinner, and finding the Airbnb. A relatively light **X steps (X miles)**.

### Hotel Emblem ★★★★✰

The rooms are very aesthetically pleasing, the staff will happily provide a mini fridge upon request.

The rooms aren't insulated too well from each other, so you may hear your neighbours. Additionally the TV was a bit unreliable in our room, so we just Chromecasted content the whole time.

Also experienced an issue where I had to pay ~$1k more than the quoted price on check-in for a week's stay, as a returnable deposit(?). When checking out they were apparently changing payment systems, so instead of refunding the $1k, they tried to ADDITIONALLY charge the final total later when I'd left... Luckily it was a travel card so didn't have that much on it and it was automatically declined repeatedly, still waiting for the refund a couple of days later though.
