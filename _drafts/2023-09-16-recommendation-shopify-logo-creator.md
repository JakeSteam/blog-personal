For a project recently, I needed a "good enough" logo for basic branding. Whilst in the past I've made my own, I'm way too rusty these days, and don't even have Photoshop installed! As such, I looked for online services, finding most of them requiring payment or having bad licensing. Luckily, Hatchful by Shopify seems to do everything I needed, including full ownership of the output!

## Overview

Since Hatchful is clearly a "loss leader" to get people using Shopify, it's not too surprising that their offering is fully featured and completely free.

Obviously the logos aren't going to be *perfect*, but I found the created logos were actually much higher quality than I expected. A few other sites provided "free" logos that were low resolution, obviously autogenerated, or were just otherwise unsuitable.

## My logo

The project I wanted to create a logo for was the non-profit "Code Cured The Cat" I'm currently working on. 

As this combined a "cutesy" theme (cats) and a "tech" theme (coding), I suspected I'd have trouble finding a good premade logo.

### Requirements 

As such, I had a few requirements:
1. The logo must be cat themed.
2. The logo must be modern / tech related.
3. The logo must be adaptable, e.g.:
    1. Must work at all sizes, from a website icon to a full-screen SVG.
    2. Must work on light or dark backgrounds.
    3. Must be easily customisable for specific projects.

Additionally, it had to be completely free and have no licensing restrictions whatsoever. 

### Generating process

Actually creating a logo just requires answering a few basic questions, then browsing the generated logos before personalising one.

#### Business space

First up, what field does my business (well, charity) operate in? Whilst "Tech" was an option, I chose "Pets" since a cat-based design was my top priority.

#### Visual style

Next, what visual style do I want for the logo? This was perhaps the hardest question for me, since I didn't actually know. Luckily multiple options can be selected here, so I went for:
* "Creative" to get modern designs.
* "Youthful" to get animal designs. 
* "Innovative" to get tech designs.

#### Name & slogan

Now that the number of possible designs has been narrowed down, it can optionally be personalised with business name and slogan. These can be changed easily later and don't seem to affect the designs, but I filled it in regardless.

#### Logo usage

Final question, the site asks where the logo will be used. I was concerned this was where a request for payment would suddenly appear, but nope! Insted, this is just to try and provide the most useful files for you. 

For example, I chose "Online store or website" and "Social media", and this meant I got banners and profile pictures ready for various social media platforms, in addition to the image files.

This can also be added to later.

#### Pick a logo

Finally, it's logo picking time!

Even without any customisation, the initial results look great. Admittedly only the bottom middle logo is cat-themed, but scrolling down generates tens more logos.

These logos are obviously a combination of text style + colour scheme + an icon, but the output still looks really, really good.

I found one that met all of my [Requirements](#requirements), a vector-style cat made up of geometric shapes. I wasn't a big fan of the colour scheme, so onto the next stage, editing the logo.

#### Personalising logo

There are 4 parts to a logo that can be customised. First, the name and slogan can be changed, since some designs look better without a slogan.

Next, the fonts. There are around 50-60, but for now the default sans-serif font looks nice and modern.

Perhaps most importantly, the colour scheme can be changed. These schemes are grouped by theme, and this actually offers a much better experience than just choosing specific colours. I knew I wanted a logo that worked on white & black backgrounds, so I requested "Basic" themes:
