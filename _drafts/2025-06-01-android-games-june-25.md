intro

## #1: [Heroll](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.percent.aos.rollinghero)

Sometimes a simple game with a nice aesthetic can be all you need, in this case Heroll's roguelite Monopoly-with-combat format is great for a sub-5 minute run!

### Review

As mentioned, this is basically Monopoly with enemies! Roll dice, land on a square, play a minigame or fight an enemy, and continue round and round until you or the boss dies. You'll have all the roguelite staples such as random equipment drops, health potions, shops, as well at perks / pets / relics to upgrade between runs.

The game does a great job of adding complexity on top of this relatively simple idea, with plenty of minigames (e.g. Blackjack, tapping in time, etc) as you make your way around the board. Additionally, some tiles will activate area effects (e.g. changing the next row of tiles to chests), whilst the boss in the centre will continually output enemies and debuffs to hold back your progress.

Luckily, the actual gameplay is pretty simple. Roll the dice, then enter a battle where your only control is when to drink potions (if you have any!). If you win, you get some loot and can move on. If you lose, your run is over. Easy.

The equipment upgrades are fairly linear, with each "loop" around the board upgrading the enemy and equipment levels, meaning you'll never stick with the same items for long. However, they're all about the same so it isn't too important, although it is nice seeing your character's sprite updated.

There's a solid variety of perks, stats, and effects available, with the shop offering interesting changes to the automatic combat. However, the same currency is used for health potions / potion upgrades as perks, so there's an element of risk vs reward. Ultimately it's impossible to predict if you'll fight nothing or relentless max-strength monsters before your next shop, so staying fully stocked up is the only safe option.

Whilst a single run takes 5-10 minutes, they're generally pretty easy (at least the first 4-5 bosses that I've experienced) unless you get very bad luck. This makes the energy system particularly pointless, since it's recharged by the time you've finished your run, and holds enough for 5-6 runs! Mine was never less than 85% full.

There are some odd choices of obvious engagement tricks utilised, which leave a bit of a nasty taste in the app. For example there's a standard daily reward system, but this is represented as "Deoksoon's affection", a female character wearing a maid outfit, seemingly with no relation to the actual game. There's also a daily "lucky wheel", a Pachinko based relics system, a bizarre spammy global chat, lootboxes etc, all a bit excessive and unnecessary.

In summary, Heroll is a solid game for a few minutes of simple yet satisfying gameplay, with an attractive and responsive UI. I'm probably not too interested in "finishing" it, and it's very repetitive and luck dependant, yet is a solid candidate for something to mostly pay attention to whilst watching TV or listening to a podcast.

### Monetisation

As mentioned, there's a lot of engagement and monetisation strategies in play, but the game does a fairly good job of keeping these out of the actual gameplay. Instead, they're all crammed in the mess that is between rounds, where 10 things try to grab your attention and get your money / ad view! The end result is I ignore it all, upgrade my equipment, and just dive back into the actually good bit of Heroll: the gameplay.

So, there's purchaseable "diamonds", used for gold (upgrades) and energy (playtime), buying misc perks / pets from the shop, opening pet lootboxes, as well as all the typical "packages" with various items inside. I've no intention of buying any of it, since the gameplay seems fairly simple, and the purchaseable perks just save time.

### Tips

The game is almost entirely lucky based, so there's not many tips!

1. Save your potions until you're low, but not too low health, since you'll often gain health naturally.
2. Any items that give you lifesteal / heal on battle end will be extremely powerful, since any passive restoration is very useful.
3. A higher number equipment isn't necessarily better, especially if the current equipment has a decent perk on top.
4. You should spend all your money at the shop when you can, since there's no benefit in saving up. I found buying the passive perk best, followed by improving health potion capacity / effect.
5. You can earn health potions above your maximum, but it's still worth having the capacity.

## Updates

- [I got Worms](/april-android-games-2025/#3-i-got-worms): I'm still checking in on this once or twice a day, and buying all! When I wrote the review I had ~200 upgrades purchased, I now have ~1200, although the last few achievements do look a little tricky. Still, there's a decent chance I'll end up 100%'ing it, without spending a penny.
- [Dig-Dig Rush](/may-2025-android-games/#2-dig-dig-rush): Okay, I got _really_ into Dig-Dig Rush after writing my review. Whilst the gameplay hasn't changed much, there's something deeply satisfying in spending 20 minutes watching numbers go up every morning! I eventually purchased the Â£10 (~$13) ad-free pack, permanently granting all the advert bonuses. This means lots of free items, free dungeon attempts, free speed-ups etc. I'm up to level 229, rank Duke 1, and suspect I'm starting to run out of new content.
