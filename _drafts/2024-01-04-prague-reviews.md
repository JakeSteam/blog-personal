Over Christmas and the surrounding couple of weeks, I was exploring Central Europe. The third part of this journey was Prague, where I experienced bizarre underground fire breathing, excellent Korean food, and even a bit of snow! Here are my reviews.

In total, I was in Prague from the afternoon of Fri 22nd December to just after lunch on Tue 26th.

*Note: This is part 3 of 4 from this trip: [Zurich](/zurich-reviews), [Vienna](/vienna-reviews), **Prague**, and Berlin.*

## Day 1 (22nd December): Arrival & Landmarks

We were a little uncertain what the "mood" in Prague would be, given [the shooting in the area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Prague_shooting) the day before. Thankfully, people seemed to be pretty relaxed in general, and still welcoming to tourists. 

We arrived in Prague around 3pm, so just enough time for a brief look around and dinner, giving us a total of **11,995 steps (4.82 miles) walked**.
