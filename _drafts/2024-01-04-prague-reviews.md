Over Christmas and the surrounding couple of weeks, I was exploring Central Europe. The third part of this journey was Prague, where I experienced bizarre underground fire breathing, excellent Korean food, and even a bit of snow! Here are my reviews.

In total, I was in Prague from the afternoon of Fri 22nd December to just after lunch on Tue 26th.

*Note: This is part 3 of 4 from this trip: [Zurich](/zurich-reviews), [Vienna](/vienna-reviews), **Prague**, and Berlin.*
