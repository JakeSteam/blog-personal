## #1: [Spaceplan](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devolver.spaceplan)

This might be the closest thing to a perfect incremental I've played, from setting, to story, to gameplay, to actually having an ending.

### Review

Full disclosure, I'd heard Spaceplan brought up _all the time_ in incremental game recommendations for years, and ignored it because it's a one-off purchase of Â£2.79 ($4). I should have bought it sooner.

Spaceplan starts off like a lot of incrementals, with a theme of space exploration, upgrading items that earn currency (watts), etc. What differentiates it is a complete lack of painful grind, instead it has a clear story that progresses smoothly, with the incremental aspect being more of a mild time gate instead of a way to prolong gameplay.

The story isn't too complex, but features time travel, aliens, parallel universes, and an absolutely excellent ending making the journey worth it. I'll avoid spoilers since the surprises and story is half the appeal, with high quality writing balancing comedy and standard updates on idle income etc.

Depending on how long you idle for between sessions, the game won't take more than a few hours of gameplay. I checked in perhaps 5-6 times at least an hour apart, and always had significant upgrades to buy even when between the major story plot points. There's not really any replayability unless you want to read the story again, however this shouldn't take away from the actual quality of the experience.

Whilst the game is very well-built, and has smooth interactions and graphics, I did experience some minor issues. During my playthrough the game got "stuck" twice, where nothing was available to click and I had to restart to trigger the next step. Not a dealbreaker, but worth being aware of so you don't spend too long waiting for something to appear!

### Monetisation

No ads or in-app purchases, just a one-time payment to play. Spaceplan is included free with Google Play Pass.

### Tips

You don't need many tips, this is fairly linear!

- As with any incremental, make sure you calculate the cost / reward for different tiers of upgrades to buy the more efficient option.
- At some point you need to "fire" mass by purchasing upgrades. It took me a minute to realise some purchases were actually interacting with the planet itself, and timing was important.

## #2: [Cat Museum](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.games751.catmuseum)

Huh? What did I just play? Some sort of body horror point and click game. I think.

### Review

This might be the oddest experience I've had in a mobile game.

On the surface, this is a short point and click adventure game. However, it's a very, very strange one, with the challenge level fluctuating between non-existent and impossible, all whilst staring at gore and body horror.

Whilst there's only 1-2 hours of gameplay (an [example playthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYNJkBsAGEU) is exactly 2 hours), this time is full of unique art. Every screen has intriguing and totally new artwork, with flourishes and bizarre characteristics all over the place.

It's really hard to actually summarise the game, so instead I'll summarise what you might do on a typical screen:

1. Walk to the left, tap a few odd things, read unnerving text.
2. Stare at a bafflingly strange item / person / gate.
3. Solve a simple puzzle, typically by looking at the environment and identifying which elements match the gate / key / code.
4. Move on, after some seemingly unrelated or vague dialogue.
5. Repeat.

The puzzles are fairly simple, with later puzzles being somewhat obscure (the bed headboard one is still a mystery) but minimal enough that they often can be brute forced without understanding them. A playthrough won't take you long, with the extremely linear path making this mostly a challenge of "can you find the dialogue to tap".

Overall I'm not sure I actually _enjoyed_ my time with Cat Museum, but it was definitely a unique experience. A bit over-the-top with the body horror, but on the plus side I saw things I wasn't expecting (and a negligible amount of cats)!

### Monetisation

I'm not sure. I got it as part of Google Play Pass so it was entirely free, it apparently has ads and in-app purchases though!

It costs Â£4 (currently 50% off) [on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1688100/Cat_Museum/).

### Tips

- This is a linear adventure, there's no decision-making!
- Most puzzles can be solved with something very close to the puzzle itself, have a look at nearby objects and characters.
