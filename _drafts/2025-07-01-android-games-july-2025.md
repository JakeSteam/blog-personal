## #1: [Cat Museum](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.games751.catmuseum)

Huh? What did I just play? Some sort of body horror point and click game. I think.

### Review

This might be the oddest experience I've had in a mobile game.

On the surface, this is a short point and click adventure game. However, it's a very, very strange one, with the challenge level fluctuating between non-existent and impossible, all whilst staring at gore and body horror.

Whilst there's only 1-2 hours of gameplay (an [example playthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYNJkBsAGEU) is exactly 2 hours), this time is full of unique art. Every screen has intriguing and totally new artwork, with flourishes and bizarre characteristics all over the place.

It's really hard to actually summarise the game, so instead I'll summarise what you might do on a typical screen:

1. Walk to the left, tap a few odd things, read unnerving text.
2. Stare at a bafflingly strange item / person / gate.
3. Solve a simple puzzle, typically by looking at the environment and identifying which elements match the gate / key / code.
4. Move on, after some seemingly unrelated or vague dialogue.
5. Repeat.

The puzzles are fairly simple, with later puzzles being somewhat obscure (the bed headboard one is still a mystery) but minimal enough that they often can be brute forced without understanding them. A playthrough won't take you long, with the extremely linear path making this mostly a challenge of "can you find the dialogue to tap".

Overall I'm not sure I actually _enjoyed_ my time with Cat Museum, but it was definitely a unique experience. A bit over-the-top with the body horror, but on the plus side I saw things I wasn't expecting (and a negligible amount of cats)!

### Monetisation

I'm not sure. I got it as part of Google Play Pass so it was entirely free, it apparently has ads and in-app purchases though!

It costs Â£4 (currently 50% off) [on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1688100/Cat_Museum/).

### Tips

- This is a linear adventure, there's no decision-making!
- Most puzzles can be solved with something very close to the puzzle itself, have a look at nearby objects and characters.
