intro

## #1: [Honey Bee Park](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.gameduo.hbp)

Let's get the obvious out of the way, [Honey Bee Park](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.gameduo.hbp) is heavily inspired by the cutesy incremental [Cats & Soup](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hidea.cat), but with bees.

### Review

The basic gameplay loop is your bees collect honey from plants, deposit it at food stations who produce food, then you sell the food for coins. That's it!

You'll use these coins to upgrade food stations and unlock new gameplay features, similar to other incremental games. There's a few other currencies (hearts for "lab" upgrades, royal jelly for "royal lab" upgrades / costumes, bee pollen for improving costumes), all of which are pretty easy to obtain.

The gameplay itself is quite active, with every item requiring manual selling (or it will autosell for a 50% discount) and every "heart" from flowers requiring a manual click.

Generally your main objective will be saving up for the next park level. Each of these will either drastically improve earnings (e.g. with a new bee), or unlock a new feature (e.g. ability to move stations). The new food stations particularly will each offer a drastic increase in earnings, since each new tier generally offers 100-1000x the previous.

This fairly linear upgrade loop means there's not much to actually think about / plan whilst playing. Instead, you can watch the bees hurrying about their business, and that's about it! Luckily, there's lots of outfits to customise them a bit.

### Monetisation

Unfortunately Honey Bee Park is heavily monetised, with the combination of powerful (optional) ad boosts and expensive ad removal options.

The full list is:

- Adverts for occasional cash gifts.
- Adverts to provide a few minutes of 2x collection & production speed.
- Adverts to double offline earnings.
- Adverts to receive costume items.
- Adverts to receive free royal jelly.
- Adverts to get "seeds" for minigame.
- Payment to remove adverts ($30!).
- Payment to double profit ($5).
- Payment to receive packs of in-app currencies ($6 - $50).
- Payments to buy royal jelly ($1 - $50).

This is a lot of monetisation, regardless of whether it is optional or not. Too much.

Due to how powerful these boosts are, you're realistically going to want to watch 7-8 adverts back to back each time you open up the game to get all the free items, double speed, etc. Or, of course, pay an absurd amount of money to remove adverts.

I'd happily pay $5 to remove ads, but the current price is absurd, so the devs get nothing except ad revenue!

### Tips

- Upgrading food stations drastically increases your earnings, but a new food station will increase them even more. Keep an eye on what is being unlocked soon to see if it's worth saving up.
- Each station has a "fill" indicator. If this is mostly empty, you need to upgrade your bees. If it's mostly full, you need to upgrade your station speed.

That's it! It's a straightforward, linear game.
