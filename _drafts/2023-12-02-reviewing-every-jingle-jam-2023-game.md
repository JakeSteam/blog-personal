[rewrite intro]
Every Christmas since 2011, one of my favourite content creators The Yogscast have organised the "Jingle Jam", a collection of streams with [an associated bundle](https://jinglejam.tiltify.com/) with TONS of great games to raise money for charity. This year, I'm trying to review all 75 of them despite only playing 2-3 games all year before this! Here's part 1, with the first 30 games. 

Mention https://www.reddit.com/r/Yogscast/comments/188p1lj/a_fast_way_to_redeem_all_jingle_jam_steam_codes/?share_id=X9P-WMBS3xosG56l1VgCH

## Rating system

I'll be using the same rating system as last year, essentially it's purely how much I personally enjoy the game, not whether it's good or not. As such, a great game might get a 1/5 if it's not a genre I enjoy, and vice versa. It's the only way to give an honest review!

* **5/5**: I had to stop myself playing this game, I'm very likely to replay this later and complete it.
* **4/5**: This was a good experience, but maybe had problems. I'll likely play it again for a little bit eventually.
* **3/5**: The game was OK. Maybe it was a bit flawed, or just obviously bad game design decisions. I'm unlikely t play it again, but didn't actively dislike it. 
* **2/5**: This was not fun. Maybe it has some positive parts, but overall I didn't enjoy my time playing.
* **1/5**: The game experience was actively unpleasant. I had to force myself to play more than a few minutes of it, and was relieved when I finally closed the game. 

I played most games for at least an hour, but some are pretty small and understood / completed after 15-20 minutes. Information on peak player count are [from SteamDB.info](https://steamdb.info/).

## 5/5 Games

### Alekon

| Steam rating | Price | Description | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [85.34% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1479390/) | £12.39 | Photograph Cute Creatures | June 2021 | 14 (June 2021) |

It's Pokémon Snap, but remade!

I'm an absolute sucker for these kind of games, where the core gameplay is very chill and straightforward but the occasional minigame adds complexity. Alekon has 2 main gameplay areas:
1. Photography locations, where you take pictures of cute little creatures in their natural habitat.
2. The overworld, where you complete challenges for the unlocked characters.

The photography location gameplay is almost identical to Pokémon Snap, even down to throwing ~~rocks~~ donuts! The overworld quests are varied and interesting, with a mixture of reaction minigames, logical minigames, and dialog minigames.

It's hard to explain why the "simple but engaging" games are so enjoyable, but this definitely hits all the right spots. Small attention to detail bits like automatic photo management and unlimited camera reel gets rid of the annoying bits. For example, if you take a better photo of a creature, it automatically replaces the past photo.

I'll almost certainly be coming back to 100% this, I'm around 20% through so far!

### A Short Hike

| Steam rating | Price | Description | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [96.52% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1055540/) | £5.79 | Chill Cozy Climbing | July 2019 | 229 (September 2021) |

This is an absolutely lovely adventure game, and whilst it's relatively short it has so, so many little bits and pieces hidden for those that like to explore. Essentially you're a little bird making your way up a mountain, meeting lots of new friends and completing miniquests on the way. 

The dialog is well written, with character's personalities being expressed in just a few messages. It's usually worth speaking to a character multiple times, since you'll get extra snippets of dialog or even completely new quests.

I actually already owned this game from a giveaway a year or two ago, and pretty much 100% completed it. As such, I didn't take play through it all *again*, instead here's Yogscast's Angory Tom playing it a few years ago!

### Cat Quest

| Steam rating | Price | Description | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [92.12% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/593280/) | £9.99 | Cat Combat RPG | August 2017 | 1,651 (September 2019) |

Admittedly I was initially interested in Cat Quest due to the cat theme but... the game is great too! Combat is a pretty standard "melee + dodge + spells" affair, with the gameplay flowing very smoothly if using a controller. The ability to "zoom out" and get an overview of the surrounding area was much appreciated, and helped when navigating to off-screen locations.

All the concepts were immediately understandable, with equipment perks always showing nice low numbers (e.g. +2 health instead of +150). Additionally, dungeons warn you beforehand the approximate combat level you should be, allowing the in-dungeon UI to be very minimal, with no combat levels or stats.

Cat Quest didn't seem to do anything especially new, but it did deliver typical RPG elements in a very polished manner. The writing was minimal, but intelligent and entertaining without being embarrassing. I'll definitely be coming back to this one after the Jingle Jam to finish it off.

Interestingly, there seems to be a very similar, but better, sequel: [Cat Quest II](https://store.steampowered.com/app/914710/Cat_Quest_II/). There's even a third game coming out next year, unsurprisingly called [Cat Quest III](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305840/Cat_Quest_III/)!

## 4/5 Games

### 8-Bit Armies

| Steam rating | Price | Description | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [78.86% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/427250/) | £12.79 | Blocky Pixel Strategy | April 2016 | 600 (May 2016) |

I'm generally not a RTS fan, but this simple and intuitive voxel-based game was instantly understandable and enjoyable. It reminded me a lot of [a demo I played endlessly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSiXfIK-f1c) back in the 90s(!) of "WarGames", due to the very similar methods of building and moving units. 

I only played a few of the campaign missions, and they were obviously ramping up in difficulty. Even in the very first non-tutorial mission, the enemy will start scouting your area, testing your defences etc. I didn't get a good enough feel for the AI's intelligence, but it definitely seems like it won't just turtle and wait for you to attack.

However, whilst the gameplay is fun, there are a few odd areas. For example, "supply crates" are scattered all over the map, and opening them seemed to give me 5 troops every time. The tooltip warned they can contain negative rewards, but when the vast majority of my army were free crate troops, it made building up my troop producing capability almost pointless. Seemingly the best tactic is to just scatter infantry everywhere and open boxes!

Whilst on the topic of infantry, during one mission I charged my 20 or so troops at the enemy's base. They were then almost entirely killed by a supply truck blindly driving through to pick up supplies. Why is a non-controlled resource gatherer unit more powerful than military troops with rocket launchers!? I get vehicles can run over people but... why didn't my guys shoot? They just lined up and got squished.

This unfortunately isn't the only issue. The game features a "battle cam" that somewhat randomly provides a cinematic view of a battle. I couldn't figure out how to make it actually focus on anything useful, and the game crashed at one point whilst using it. Not ideal.

Despite this I still had a good time, and I can easily see it being a decent game to play PVP. 4/5 is probably the highest I can ever rate an RTS!

### Aces & Adventures

| Steam rating | Price | Description | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [87.95% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1815570/) | £14.28 | Deal Life and Death | February 2023 | 2,455 (February 2023) |

This was one of the bundle games people were most excited about, and it's even published by Yogscast Games! I'll openly admit that despite playing plenty, I've always struggled to enjoy monster card-based games like Hearthstone. However, I've absolutely loved games like [Sword & Poker](https://toucharcade.com/2010/01/12/sword-poker-a-fantastic-hybrid-of-poker-and-rpg/) waaay back in 2010 on iOS. What makes these games different is they use a regular deck of playing cards as a starting point, instead of a completely new deck of abilities and monsters.

In Aces & Adventures' case, you take it in turns to play a number card (and potentially an ability or two). Rhe number on a playing card determines how useful it is, as you have to match or beat each other's number. You'll also have abilities that require specific cards (e.g. drinking a health potion requires sacrificing 2 heart cards), meaning every turn requires balancing risk vs reward to deal damage whilst still being able to protect yourself.

This is all wrapped up in a rogue-like bundle, with even the story and route planning being told via cards! I really appreciate this dedication to being card-based, and makes the card gameplay feel like the core part of the game, not some sort of minigame.

This is close to a 5/5, however I found myself a bit "lost" due to no overworld map, and an odd "forest clearing" main menu. This also made it a little hard to know *why* I was fighting things, I seem to have stumbled across half of them whilst they were quietly chilling!

Oh, and everything is voiced. Excellent.

### Cosmo's Quickstop

| Steam rating | Price | Description | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [84.85% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/724680/) | £15.49 | Frantic Alien Cleanup | August 2021 | 28 (August 2021) |

Cosmo's Quickstop is very, very frantic, and very, very fun. You're an alien completing menial tasks for customers to a space gas station, and there's always tasks to do!

None of these individual tasks are hard (pump some gas, press a button combo, restock the vending machine, clean the toilet, etc), but when there's 5 things at once that want your attention, prioritisation is tricky. For example, you might be halfway through cleaning the toilets when an asteroid alarm goes off, whilst 2 ships are starting to run out of time. Oh and some other customers need directions.

I found that I was really bad at giving people map instructions (direct their ship to the planet without any asteroids), since they're located between the docking stations. As I rushed between areas I completely missed them!

The base gameplay is pretty good, and is improved by an upgrade system that lets you make your weak tasks easier, adds new functionality, or even add new utilities entirely. I noticed in a loading screen that the game eventually goes up to 8(!) docks, I was barely managing to handle 4! 

Out of morbid curiosity, I [found some "speedrun" style videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E530xEH2GXg&list=PLg93jKIExgIs1TJI5FtimDRRN4nmQiVta&index=8), and they do a really good job of summarising the frantic madness within the game. The player is running around doing things constantly, and it looks like a planned a speedrun until you realise everything is random, so the player is dynamically adjusting their plans. Watching it, I can't even keep track of *where* they are in the space station, let alone what they're doing.

I can definitely see myself coming back to this game when I need to "fill my brain" up for a bit, and stop thinking about something else. 👽

### Buggos

| Steam rating | Price | Description | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [82.30% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/789660/) | £11.39 | Bug Auto-battler | March 2022 | 257 (March 2022) |

Buggos is a pretty straight-forward "build a bug empire and squish the humans" style game (is that a genre?). There's all the various classes you'd expect for your (alien) buggos, such as ranged units, builders that can build spawners, etc. The enemy humans have guns, flamethrowers, and defenses.

Gameplay is very simple, turtle in your corner, defending as necessary, then zerg rush the smallest accessible enemy outpost. Repeat until there are no humans left. Interestngly, you can't control individual units, only put a pin where you want all buggos of a certain time to navigate to. This limits any advanced movement e.g. flanking, instead "rush as a horde" is the only tactic possible.

Admittedly this makes sense for bugs, but it still felt like a lot of the game I wasn't doing much beyond waiting. You can also set all of your bugs to be in "spawn", "fight", or "gather" mode, providing a slight boost to different attributes. There's a fairly detailed upgrade tree (see screenshot), but all of the upgrades felt very incremental not game-changing.

I played through the first "world" (7 levels), and they were all very straightforward. After beating it, I loaded up the hardest level in the 2nd world and it was unfortunately just more of the same. Sure, more enemies, more defenses, more enemy spawners, but nothing was really *different*. Not sure I'll be picking this up again.

### Beyond Blue

| Steam rating | Price | Description | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [83.45% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/883360/) | £15.49 | Deep Sea Exploration | June 2020 | 303 (June 2020) |

In a world where Subnautica didn't exist, this game might have been massive. Unfortunately, Subnautica does exist, and seems to do almost everything this game does, plus an absurd amount more.

I completed the 1st dive (of 8), and the only gameplay was swimming to areas and pressing "A" or scanning fish. No challenge, no excitement, just meandering around scanning fish. I tried headbutting a shark to no avail.

This game is evidently more story driven than other sea games, but the story elements are completely disjointed from the gameplay. Whilst the dive is mostly alone, with occasional voice comms, once it's over you end up in a tiny submarine, with a few voice calls to work through.

Beyond Blue seems to emphasise conservationism, containing various interviews with real world ocean experts. It also has a bizarrely high profile voice cast:
> Experience an evocative narrative with full voice cast - Anna Akana (YouTube), Mira Furlan (Lost, Babylon 5), Hakeem Kae-Kazim (Black Sails, Hotel Rwanda), and Ally Maki (Toy Story 4)

The swimming movement is somewhat smooth, although navigating through tight spaces can be a little frustrating. I'd really recommend Subnautica instead, sorry!

### Candy Disaster

| Steam rating | Price | Description | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [79.07% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1231460/) | £10.99 | Trap Tower Defence | November 2021 | 144 (Nivember 2023) |

It's hard to love or hate Candy Disaster. If you played games like Bloon Tower Defense a decade or two ago, you know how this goes. One slight variant is that "traps" are used instead of towers. This does add a bit of complexity, since you're also trying to move the incoming enemies not just damage them.

A pretty successful tactic is to use movement & blocking tiles to group enemies up as much as possible, then do extremely high damage with spike traps. If this is done well, enemies will barely get a tile or two into your maze.

However, I'm sure by now every possible variant of Tower Defence has been made already, including this. A slight change in how towers work is not enough to make this a good game, it's just yet another TD game. If you haven't already, I do recommend trying [Sanctum](https://store.steampowered.com/app/91600/Sanctum/), a better looking, better playing, deeper, and cheaper FPS/TD hybrid released 12 years ago. 

Anyway, back to Candy Disaster. There's typos in the store page, tower descriptions, achievements, and just a general lack of attention to detail everywhere. The store page advertises "35 bases", which considering their simplistic tile based design, is... really not many. Why not add Steam Workshop maps, or a level generator, so it has a chance of success?

Oh, right, because it's [actually a mobile game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.acegames.candy.disaster.tdbattles.gp) with microtransactions. That explains it.

### A Story Beside

| Steam rating | Price | Description | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [88.88% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/634410/) | £11.39 | Heartwarming Cozy Journey | May 2022 | 20 (September 2019) |

This really wasn't for me. I found A Story Beside exceptionally slow, with essentially no actual gameplay. Whilst it *looks* like a typical RPG, it's actually extremely linear. Walk to the place you have to walk to, listen to a dialog, and move on. This might imply the game is focusing on dialog decisions, like The Walking Dead, but... nope, these don't matter either.

For example, one of the 8 decisions (e.g. the only gameplay) I made in the first chapter was whether I gave food to the brown-tinted goat or the black-tinted goat. Who cares? They're just identical sprites with different colours.

There is occasional voiceover by a narrator, but all of the in-game conversations will be text only besides generic "surprise" noises etc. This made skimreading the dialog very dull, especially when combined with having to press "A" many times between each message, occasionally wait for an exclamation mark to appear above a character's head etc. Half hour in, I just didn't care about any of the characters.

Finally, for a game all about interacting with the environment, it seems entirely guess work based. There's no way to know if something will progress the story, display some information, or do nothing, without walking up to it. This means you'll be running around houses staring at chests that do nothing, items that can't be picked up, doors that are locked, etc. Early on in the game you have to find a hiding spot, and I found the correct hiding spot... too early, so had to visit a "bad" hiding spot first. What a waste of time.

People seem to enjoy this, but I do not! Perhaps it should have been a short film or a book instead.

### Arcade Spirits

| Steam rating | Price | Description | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [88.30% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/910630/) | £16.99 | Retro-gaming Dating Sim | February 2019 | 136 (February 2019) |

OK so I was never going to enjoy a dating sim, regardless of the theme. It was doomed from the start.

The dialogue is extremely simplistic, and there's *so* many words to actually say anything. I was spamming the space bar throughout and could still easily read all of the story. The target audience is obviously much, much younger than me.

The actual gameplay is what you'd expect. Read many words, make a minor A or B decision that influences your "score" in various areas. Flirty answer influences your relationship, logical answer influences your logic score, you know how this works. To see what happens if you max out, I always chose Naomi's romantic options, hence the final full bars. The result? Well, nothing.

I only played the first chapter, so I presume the story will deepen beyond the extreme shallowness I've seen so far. I personally couldn't stand how hard every single character was trying to be as quirky as possible.

Oh, and I "lost" the game at my very first decision by deciding to go look for a job normally, not waste my time with a virtual assistant app my (quirky, of course) roommate recommended. This resulted in the naive teenage viewpoint of "yeah you got an office job, a stable life, a wife and kids, but you were SAD so you LOST". I then had to restart. I kinda knew by then the game wasn't going to have a similar viewpoint to me!

### Astronimo

| [78.11% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808640/) | £12.79 | Build Bots Assemble | September 2013 | 17 (November 2023) |

What an infuriating game. Astronimo is primarily a platformer, with a vehicle builder shoved inside. I'd like to think I'm *okay* at understanding tutorials, yet multiple parts just didn't seem to make sense (such as trying to lift a box over my head... that I need to stand on?). Despite this, I made it most of the way through the tutorial world, before the awful swinging controls made me give up.

On the Steam page I saw some element of "sharing worlds" is available, so I tried to play some workshop maps in case they were less painful, but... there didn't seem to be an option. The game also has a "lane" based system, but only seems to remember it exists occasionally. Same with currency. Same with zooming out to view other planets.

The construction seemed basic (grid based, move components and connect them), none of the physics interactions felt right, and overall I just didn't enjoy it at all. It's hard to quantify why it felt so unpleasant, perhaps it's the combination of very childish UI & design, plus confusing controls, making the target audience a mystery. 

The game has only just entered early access, so perhaps it'll be a better game after few rounds of improving & simplifying.

### Battlestar Galactica: Deadlock

| Steam rating | Price | Description | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [81.20% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/544610/) | £33.50 | Space Ballet Shooting | August 2017 | 2,143 (April 2023) |

I cannot *stand* this style of strategy game, where you plan all your ship's movements in 3D space, then all the actions are taken at once. There was [a similar one I reviewed](/reviewing-every-jingle-jam-steam-game-part-2/#aeronautica-imperialis-flight-command) from last year's Jingle Jam ("Aeronautica Imperialis: Flight Command"), and they feel identical.

Even a quick skirmish takes countless repetitive turns. You have very limited options, all the ships are essentially just dancing around each other in space, it's the most dull representation of space combat possible.

Upon first opening the game -- that would have been pretty expensive if not in the Jingle Jam bundle -- I was met with an advert to buy other games. There were also adverts for various DLCs. There was also no story, cutscene, engagement, anything to grab my interest. 

Once I closed the various adverts, I was thrown into the emptiness of space with a couple of ships. Who am I? Who am I fighting? Why should I care? Does this have any link to the Battlestar Galactica TV show I've watched? Who knows. 

As with many strategy games, people seem to love this! Good for them! I don't, and was hoping for so much more. Perhaps it's one of those games that only gets good tens of hours in. I won't be finding out.

This game started with a fully voiced, impressive cutscene. There was a story, corporate drama, robots, all looks great!

Oh, and then it revealed itself to be one of those "create the requested food" cooking games. Y'know, the Flash games that used to be super popular 15-20 years ago. Whilst the keyboard / controller controls were smooth (e.g. using trigger + button to select a topping), it's just too painfully dull for me. This does seem like one of the better games in the genre, but it's not a genre I can ever enjoy.

There is an impressive variety of dishes here, but the "cooking" of them is always just going to be pressing a few buttons in the correct order. I also experienced a few bugs during gameplay, with screenshots not working, and some UI elements getting stuck for a bit.

This game was hard work. The first 3 times I tried to launch it, the screen froze and I had to close the game. Steam also never seemed to know if it was running or not. Luckily, I tried launching it with my controller unplugged, and it finally actually loaded! Whilst I can't prove DEPLOYMENT is to blame, after my first and only session with DEPLOYMENT my Steam actually reported a critical component had failed and Steam had to restart. It then had to reinstall some sort of key Steam service. Great.

As an obviously multiplayer first game, I queued up for deathmatch and team deathmatch... both of which had 0 other players. I was put into a 2v2 game with 3 obvious bots, and the difficulty was essentially zero.

My AI companion spent the entire time running in a circle shooting at walls, whilst the enemy spawned and blindly charged at me every time. It was very easy to claim the powerups and slaughter the AI enemies. Fun for a minute or two, but there's no challenge.

The game has a couple of elements that *could* be good, such as powering up turrets to provide area abilities, and entering an "ultimate" mode to deal more damage. This is countered by the extremely limited options (only low or high graphic settings with high providing less than 60 FPS), zero playerbase, and technical bugginess. For example, finishing a game provides almost no information on how you performed, accuracy, etc. 

I'm rating DEPLOYMENT especially low due to a simple controller breaking it, the endless technical problems, and there being no interesting gameplay without other players. A short single player campaign would have made this somewhat enjoyable, ah well.
