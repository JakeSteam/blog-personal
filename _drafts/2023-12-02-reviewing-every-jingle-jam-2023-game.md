[rewrite intro]
Every Christmas since 2011, one of my favourite content creators The Yogscast have organised the "Jingle Jam", a collection of streams with [an associated bundle](https://jinglejam.tiltify.com/) with TONS of great games to raise money for charity. This year, I'm trying to review all 75 of them despite only playing 2-3 games all year before this! Here's part 1, with the first 30 games.

## Rating system

I'll be using the same rating system as last year, essentially it's purely how much I personally enjoy the game, not whether it's good or not. As such, a great game might get a 1/5 if it's not a genre I enjoy, and vice versa. It's the only way to give an honest review!

* **5/5**: I had to stop myself playing this game, I'm very likely to replay this later and complete it.
* **4/5**: This was a good experience, but maybe had problems. I'll likely play it again for a little bit eventually.
* **3/5**: The game was OK. Maybe it was a bit flawed, or just obviously bad game design decisions. I'm unlikely t play it again, but didn't actively dislike it. 
* **2/5**: This was not fun. Maybe it has some positive parts, but overall I didn't enjoy my time playing.
* **1/5**: The game experience was actively unpleasant. I had to force myself to play more than a few minutes of it, and was relieved when I finally closed the game. 

I played most games for at least an hour, but some are pretty small and understood / completed after 15-20 minutes. Information on peak player count are [from SteamDB.info](https://steamdb.info/).

## 5/5 Games

### A Short Hike

| Steam rating | Price | Description | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [96.52% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1055540/) | Â£5.79 | Chill Cozy Climbing | July 2019 | 229 (September 2021) |

This is an absolutely lovely adventure game, and whilst it's relatively short it has so, so many little bits and pieces hidden for those that like to explore. Essentially you're a little bird making your way up a mountain, meeting lots of new friends and completing miniquests on the way. 

The dialog is well written, with character's personalities being expressed in just a few messages. It's usually worth speaking to a character multiple times, since you'll get extra snippets of dialog or even completely new quests.

I actually already owned this game from a giveaway a year or two ago, and pretty much 100% completed it. As such, I didn't take play through it all *again*, instead here's Yogscast's Angory Tom playing it a few years ago!
