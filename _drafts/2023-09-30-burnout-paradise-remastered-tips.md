Okay, so *maybe* Burnout Paradise isn't the hot new racing game, but it *is* an absolute classic with extremely satisfying gameplay. I recently completed it after finding it on Xbox / EA Game Pass, here's a few tips I picked up along the way.

I had vague memories of playing Burnout Paradise for a few hours years ago. However, I've got a few (hundred...) hours of Forza Horizon and other games under my sleeve now, making this playthrough much easier than last time. For reference, completing the main game and earning a "Burnout License" took me around 7-8 hours. There are multiple [additional licenses for completionists](https://burnout.fandom.com/wiki/License) that I'm slowly working towards!

* Make sure to add tips from reddit post (and link it ofc)

## Intro

In general, once you've got to grips with your preferred cars you *should* realistically be winning most events first time. They are very repetitive, essentially different start & end points across different [game modes](#game-modes).

However, there is an element of luck. Even the best players will be completely blindsided by traffic at the last corner in a race, or not react quickly enough to a crash up ahead. Luckily, the first tip will help with this...

## Menus

### 1. Right on d-pad to restart event

This blew my mind when I discovered it! Pressing right on the d-pad during (or after) an event will let you restart it instantly. 

I only recommend using this for when a race or time trial is clearly unwinnable, for all other event types you can probably save the run.

### 2. Opening the map pauses the game

Pressing select opens a large map, and during races you should absolutely be using this to plan your route! Luckily, the game pauses whilst looking at the map, so I usually plan out the next few corners then pause again.

## Overworld

### 3. End events in dense areas

For events that don't have a fixed path (e.g. all except races), where possible you should aim to finish in an area where you have plenty of events to complete (e.g. the city). This will reduce your downtime between events.

### 4. Drive through all repair shops

Whenever you spot a repair shop, drive through it. Finding one quickly can be crucial during Marked Man mode, so unlocking them all early is helpful.

### 5. Drive through all intersections

Events are unlocked and added to the map by just driving over the intersection where they can be started. As such, unlocking all the events early is useful for planning your time.

The easiest way to do this is to try taking new routes when navigating to events in free roam.

## Progression

### 6. Reduce downtime with a versatile car

Assuming you have a versatile "Aggression" style car, it can probably win all events. As such, when you've finished an event you might as well just start whichever is nearest.

This tactic works well up until you start running out of events to complete.

### 7. Upgrading license resets events

Whenever you earn a new license, all previously completed events can be completed again. This lets you speed through wins by repeating any past events you found easy.

### 8. Post-credit completionist licenses exist

Despite the game playing the credits when you earn your Burnout license, you're actually only around 30-40% through the game! There are [quite a few additional licenses](https://burnout.fandom.com/wiki/License) that get progressively harder and harder, eventually even getting above 100% completion.

## Driving

### 9. Takedowns are crucial
* Easy boost
* Massive advantage

### 10. A takedown can save you
* If a car is taken down, the cutscene saves you and steers briefly

### 11. Do not crash
* No really, you'll lose SO much time

## Cars

### 12. Drive whatever you want
* No need to win with specific cars to unlock cars
* 

### 13. Types of boost
* Types of boost

### 14. A faster car isn't necessarily better

### 15. There is no best car
* Talk about Spur
* A good car can do almost any event

### Special vehicle packs

When I first opened the game, I was pretty confused by all the DLCs included in the remastered edition. Tiny cars, legendary cars, motorbikes!? Here's a brief overview.

#### 16. Bikes

Motorbikes drive very differently to the normal cars, and crash extremely easily. Whilst you can perform a wheelie or lean forward with them, there's no boost or handbrake turn. 

Progression with them is totally separate from the main game, you'll be working towards a "Rider License" by completing all the events.

Whilst technically all the bikes have different speeds and strengths, I found them all ridiculously fast and fragile!

#### 17. Legendary cars

[![](/assets/images/2023/burnout-legendary.png)](/assets/images/2023/burnout-legendary.png)

This is a small collection of 4 cars, each of which is pretty powerful and usually has a unique ability. They're also all pretty obvious homages to famous cars!
1. "[Jansen P12 88 Special](https://burnout.fandom.com/wiki/Jansen_P12_88_Special)" from Back to the Future: Has the ability to leave flame trails behind the wheels, and (slightly) hover off the ground.
2. "[Hunter Cavalry Bootlegger](https://burnout.fandom.com/wiki/Hunter_Cavalry_Bootlegger)" from The Dukes of Hazzard: Has the famous car's horn.
3. "[Hunter Manhattan Spirit](https://burnout.fandom.com/wiki/Hunter_Manhattan_Spirit)" from Ghostbusters: Has the famous car's lights and sirens.
4. "[Carson GT Nighthawk](https://burnout.fandom.com/wiki/Carson_GT_Nighthawk)" from Knight Rider: Has the famous car's lights, sound, and spoiler.

#### 18. Boost special cars

There are 2 cars that exist purely to show off unique boost mechanics:
1. "[Carson Extreme Hot Rod](https://burnout.fandom.com/wiki/Carson_Extreme_Hot_Rod)": Once you start to boost you can't stop!
2. "[Montgomery Hawker Mech](https://burnout.fandom.com/wiki/Montgomery_Hawker_Mech)": Can switch between all 3 [boost types](#types-of-boost) instantly, also changing the driving style.

#### 19. Toy cars

[![](/assets/images/2023/burnout-toys.png)](/assets/images/2023/burnout-toys.png)

The [toy car](https://burnout.fandom.com/wiki/Toys) pack is very silly. They are just smaller versions of existing cars, and are very disorientating to drive. They can perform all events, although they are pretty tricky to control!

#### 20. Police cars

[![](/assets/images/2023/burnout-cops.jpg)](/assets/images/2023/burnout-cops.jpg)

The 33 police cars are literally just reskins of cars from the main game with identical stats. Early on, they can be a good way to drive more powerful cars than you have access to in the main game.

## Game modes

### Races

#### 21. Fewest turns route is best

I found that corners and complexity were my worst enemies. A slightly less direct route that was very simple usually ended up better for me than one with multiple twists and turns.

Part of this is due to the distraction caused by having to pause more often, plus the disruption to boosts that might occur. Additionally, turning any corner is a risk, since traffic can come out of nowhere and turning isn't guaranteed.

#### 22. Plan carefully

Since the game is paused during a race, there's no point rushing. Plan out your route, memorise as much as you can, then off you go!

#### 23. Copy the AI until the end

Alternatively, if you're unsure of the best route, copying the AI is pretty easy. They'll drive a pretty optimal route, and will be easy to overtake (or they'll crash), so following them up until 1 mile before the end is an easy way to win without any planning.

#### 24. Boost mid-turn

If you're in a car where boosting is always available (and you should be!), an easy way to turn a corner is to handbrake turn, then boost to cancel your momentum.

### Marked man

#### 25. Off road long paths are best

For Marked man, chase cars will spawn mostly on roads. As such, long sections of off-road roads are the easiest way to reach the destination. For example, the railroads are by far the best way to get around if they're on your route.

#### 26. Turn at the last minute

The chase cars will somewhat try and predict your turns and cut you off / T-bone you. Counteract this by not trying to hit the apex of a corner, and instead just handbrake turning when you reach it.

#### 27. Use every auto shop

No matter how well you drive, the chase cars will get you occasionally. Make sure your route goes past as many auto shops as possible, and use them even if you've only been taken down once.

### Road rage

#### 28. Direction doesn't matter

Similar to marked man, it doesn't matter which direction you drive. As such, you can drive to easy takedown spots (see next tip), as well as steering towards an autoshop since you'll probably take some damage. 

#### 29. Bully speed / small cars

See a small, fast car zooming past you? Great, aim for them first! They're weak easy to take down, and will help you reach the target faster.

#### 30. Bump strong cars from behind

Strong cars, like vans, can generally muscle you out if you try to barge them from the side. 

#### 31. Nudge weak cars from the middle / back

If a car is weaker than you, it's very vulnerable to being pushed from the side. Driving alongside it and aggressively nudging it sideways will usually result in a takedown. It doesn't matter much which part of the car you get, but the middle or back is more likely to spin the target out of control.

#### 32. Stop when target reached

When you reach your target takedown count, just stop driving. The event will successfully end in a few seconds.

#### 33. Long, predictable stretches are ideal

For taking out other cars, long stretches of narrow road are ideal. In these, you can easily drive alongside any car and take them out.

Personally I love the long bridge in the south-west with jumps in the middle. Nudging cars is very easy, and you can safely get 6-7 takedowns by the end of the bridge.

### Stunt run

#### 34. Final run is infinitely long

Just because your time has run out doesn't mean you're actually out of time! When it reaches 00:00, you can actually keep going until your combo runs out or you crash. 

Since boosting or drifting can extend your combo timer, you have far more time than the timer indicates, so don't feel too rushed.

#### 35. Find your favourite spot

After playing the game for a few hours, you'll probably have a few areas in mind that are reliable for improving your stunt multiplier by destroying billboards.

Personally I'm a big fan of the main South/North road on the east of the city. It has a few massive jumps as well as multiple billboards, plus it's nice and wide reducing the risk of unexpected obstacles. As such, I tend to end up here during my stunt runs.

#### 36. Crashing at the end is fine

If you end your run in a crash, the points are still banked! There's no need to safely come to a stop.

### Burning route

#### 37. Plan carefully

These timed routes are genuinely quite challenging, especially if you pick a poor route. As such, it's worth spending a bit of time planning your complete route at the very start of the race. There are no rivals to follow, so good luck!
