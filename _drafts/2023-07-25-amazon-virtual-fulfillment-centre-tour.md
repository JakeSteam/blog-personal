Whilst scrolling Instagram recently, I saw a sponsored post to [tour an Amazon factory](https://www.amazontours.com/na/virtual). As someone who [uses Amazon heavily](https://jakelee.co.uk/analysing-my-amazon-purchases/), I was intrigued. This unfortunately turned out to just be a *virtual* tour, but I still decided to give it a go! And no, this isn't a sponsored post, I promise ðŸ˜…

The [booking a spot](#booking-a-spot) and [expectations](#expectations) parts of this article have been written before the actual tour.

## Booking a spot

First, here's the Instagram post that piqued my interest:

After booking a time that worked for me, I received a confirmation email. Interestingly, they seemed happy for the viewing link to be shared as widely as possible:

Looking at the [Amazon tours FAQs](https://help.amazontours.com/hc/en-us), it looks like [anyone can sign up for a tour](https://www.amazontours.com/na/virtual), so if you like what you see in this post, maybe take one yourself!

## Expectations

This section has been written after booking my tour, but before the actual event. I've intentionally avoided reading *anything* about the tour, so these expectations are likely to be very inaccurate!

So, let's be realistic: if Amazon is sponsoring the ability to view a virtual tour, I don't see why it would be anything less than a heavily scripted PR opportunity.

### The virtual tour

It's a half hour event, and based off my general experience with onboarding and user experience testing, I'm expecting something similar to:
* 5 minutes setting up, letting people check audio settings, misc delays.
* 10 minutes presentation / prerecorded video about Amazon the company, their goals, motivations, employees, etc. 
* 10 minutes live tour through one of the fulfilment centres, paying special attention to their automation, employee experience, and how it all relates to the customer. Potentially a semi-scripted conversation with a surprisingly upbeat and enthusiastic employee!
* 5 minutes wrap-up, request for feedback, perhaps a small Q&A session.

Given the flak that Amazon often receives for how employees are treated, and fake merchandise sometimes being listed as genuine, I suspect these will be the focus areas. As Amazon is a very automation-heavy company, I expect their warehouse layout processes to be promoted heavily, and regular use of the "AI" buzzword. 

Almost 8 years ago, I read [this BBC article about Amazon's algorithm reliance](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20150818-how-algorithms-run-amazons-warehouses), and their techniques have undoubtedly evolved since then. Additionally, the tour will be of their (presumably more advanced) US centre.

### The fulfilment centre

I'm actually not sure what the inside of a fulfilment centre will look like. I do have a few preconceived notions of an extremely carefully organised and well lit large warehouse, with robots performing almost all the actual work. As this is the "public" image of these warehouses, I expect the cleanliness, lighting, and spaciousness to be somewhat better than the average centre.

### Interactivity

I strongly doubt there will be *any* part of the tour that is actually interactive.

Given that this is a controlled PR opportunity, I don't see why those attending will have any ability to communicate with each other / the organisers, besides perhaps a (curated) Q&A session. I also doubt I'll be able to see any information about how many people are attending, which is very understandable, but it would be nice to know if I'm part of a group of 10 or 1000! 

## The tour

### Intro

### Robotics

### Pick

### Pack

### SLAM

### Ship

### Q&A 

Notes:
- 15:00 - 15:01: promotional overview of the tour
- 15:02 - 15:04: intro to the process etc, with automatic robots in the background
- 15:04 - 15:09: FRA7, description of the little robots moving stacks around, overview of how the robots work (QR codes)... amnesty responders that retrieve broken things. talking about the career, paying for education for employees.
- 15:09 - 15:13: Pick stations, scanning small items and putting into the correct tote. Speaking about ergonomics, what happens when a tote is full. 
- 15:12 - 15:17: Pack station w/Riyad, from totes into boxes. Talk of algorithms, and they recommend which box to use. The algorithm controls it all!!! Recyclable, why boxes are sometimes too big, sustainability. However, no address label yet......... instead it's the "SP" barcode that goes on the packaging material.
- 15:17 - 15:20: "SLAM": scan label apply manifest, gets scanned, then mailing label is created instantly. Also includes quality check, including a weight check (to ensure no extra / missing items). Label sticking doesn't touch parcel, stops just before then uses air to blow label on.
- 15:20 - 15:27: Q&A (4-5) "Lot of AI help in place". 
- 15:27 - 15:28: POV of parcel going through all the steps from start -> giant boxes for trucks.
- 15:28 - 15:32: "Ship": Parcels down conveyor belts "chutes". Shipping people move from bottom of chutes into large storage "cages", that then get moved into lorries that arrive at prearranged time. Then go to "sortation centre", then "delivery centre" (e.g. local logistics). 
- 15:32 - 15:34: Video about "extreme" deliveries to himalayas. Superheroes: Some wear capes, others deliver them. 
- 15:34 - 15:42: More Q&A (4-5), 1m/24hr some centres.
- 15:43: Done, exit survey

AR = Amazon Robotics centre = handles the smaller packages! FRA3 etc are all clothing related. Fulfillment centres are all very similar, in terms of tech / appearance. Don't work all days, usually Mon-Sat.

Manchester distribution centre "MAN1" (man airport, building 1). Named after nearest airport.
