Whilst scrolling Instagram recently, I saw a sponsored post to [tour an Amazon factory](https://www.amazontours.com/na/virtual). As someone who [uses Amazon heavily](https://jakelee.co.uk/analysing-my-amazon-purchases/), I was intrigued. This unfortunately turned out to just be a *virtual* tour, but I still decided to give it a go! And no, this isn't a sponsored post, I promise ðŸ˜…

The [booking a spot](#booking-a-spot) and [expectations](#expectations) parts of this article have been written before the actual tour.

## Booking a spot

First, here's the Instagram post that piqued my interest:

After booking a time that worked for me, I received a confirmation email. Interestingly, they seemed happy for the viewing link to be shared as widely as possible:

Looking at the [Amazon tours FAQs](https://help.amazontours.com/hc/en-us), it looks like [anyone can sign up for a tour](https://www.amazontours.com/na/virtual), so if you like what you see in this post, maybe take one yourself!

## Expectations

This section has been written after booking my tour, but before the actual event. I've intentionally avoided reading *anything* about the tour, so these expectations are likely to be very inaccurate!

So, let's be realistic: if Amazon is sponsoring the ability to view a virtual tour, I don't see why it would be anything less than a heavily scripted PR opportunity.

### The virtual tour

It's a half hour event, and based off my general experience with onboarding and user experience testing, I'm expecting something similar to:
* 5 minutes setting up, letting people check audio settings, misc delays.
* 10 minutes presentation / prerecorded video about Amazon the company, their goals, motivations, employees, etc. 
* 10 minutes live tour through one of the fulfilment centres, paying special attention to their automation, employee experience, and how it all relates to the customer. Potentially a semi-scripted conversation with a surprisingly upbeat and enthusiastic employee!
* 5 minutes wrap-up, request for feedback, perhaps a small Q&A session.

Given the flak that Amazon often receives for how employees are treated, and fake merchandise sometimes being listed as genuine, I suspect these will be the focus areas. As Amazon is a very automation-heavy company, I expect their warehouse layout processes to be promoted heavily, and regular use of the "AI" buzzword. 

Almost 8 years ago, I read [this BBC article about Amazon's algorithm reliance](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20150818-how-algorithms-run-amazons-warehouses), and their techniques have undoubtedly evolved since then. Additionally, the tour will be of their (presumably more advanced) US centre.

### The fulfilment centre

I'm actually not sure what the inside of a fulfilment centre will look like. I do have a few preconceived notions of an extremely carefully organised and well lit large warehouse, with robots performing almost all the actual work. As this is the "public" image of these warehouses, I expect the cleanliness, lighting, and spaciousness to be somewhat better than the average centre.

### Interactivity

I strongly doubt there will be *any* part of the tour that is actually interactive.

Given that this is a controlled PR opportunity, I don't see why those attending will have any ability to communicate with each other / the organisers, besides perhaps a (curated) Q&A session. I also doubt I'll be able to see any information about how many people are attending, which is very understandable, but it would be nice to know if I'm part of a group of 10 or 1000! 

## The tour

Time has passed, and I have now been on the virtual tour!

I'll run through what each part of the tour covered, along with the occasional screenshot. As this was primarily a live broadcast I didn't feel comfortable capturing the presenters, so all images are from pre-prepared videos or the background of shots.

The ~45m tour included:

* 15:00 - 15:04: [Intro](#intro)
* 15:04 - 15:09: [Robotics](#robotics)
* 15:09 - 15:13: [Pick](#pick)
* 15:13 - 15:17: [Pack](#pack)
* 15:17 - 15:20: [SLAM](#slam)
* 15:20 - 15:27: [Q&A 1](#qas)
* 15:27 - 15:34: [Ship](#ship)
* 15:34 - 15:43: [Q&A 2](#qas)
* 15:43: End & exit survey

### Intro

Before the tour started, the invite link took me to a fairly standard "Reception" / lobby area, with a nudge to join "Stage" a minute or two before the stage started. As expected there was no interaction with other guests, or any indicator of how many people were there.  

[![](/assets/images/2023/amazon-before-thumbnail.png)](/assets/images/2023/amazon-before.png)

The tour started off with a very sleek and corporate prerecorded ~1 minute promotional video for the tours, which was essentially just an advert. Next, our tour guide "Hannah" introduced herself on camera, unexpectedly standing inside the UK fulfilment centre "MAN1" instead of a sleek flagship warehouse in the USA! 

She gave a brief explanation behind the naming system (MAN1 = building 1 near airport "MAN" (Manchester)), and how this code is actually visible on all packages received by Amazon. Whilst a small and probably obvious detail, this fun fact was a great way to make it feel at least somewhat educational.

Throughout this, the relatively well known Amazon robots were driving around in the background, picking up stacks of items to move them around. I'd seen these before, but it was pretty interesting seeing them just going about their job without being the main focus. This led onto the next section: Robotics.

### Robotics

This section was the one I was most looking forward to, but was sadly only 5 minutes long! Hannah in Manchester was joined by a colleague in FRA7 (Frankfurt building 7), who explained how the robots work at a high level.

I won't go into detail about these robots, since [it is all easily readable elsewhere](https://www.aboutamazon.co.uk/news/operations/what-robots-do-and-dont-do-at-amazon-fulfilment-centres). They are essentially little Roombas that drive under a stack of shelves, lift them up, and take them to a human at a picking station. They coordinate their routes with all other little robots in the warehouse, and work using QR codes on every stack of shelves and floor tile:

[![](/assets/images/2023/amazon-robotics.png)](/assets/images/2023/amazon-robotics.png)

Interestingly, our tour guide discussed what happens when items occasionally fall off shelves: a human goes in to help! These are given the somewhat dystopian name "Amnesty Responders", and put on a robot-nullifying identifier before entering the robot's cage. Once inside, all robots anywhere near the responder stay perfectly still, so that the responder can fix whatever is wrong. This was all explained in a non-technical manner by another sleek marketing video.

[![](/assets/images/2023/amazon-amnesty-responder.png)](/assets/images/2023/amazon-amnesty-responder.png)

This topic also segued neatly onto employees, a recurring theme throughout. The pretty standard sales pitch was given, about Amazon helping employees to progress, paying for some of their education, and how "employees are supported and looked after". I'll reserve my scepticism here for [Impressions](#impressions)!

### Pick

The robots then take the yellow stack of shelves over to a "pick station": a human putting items into boxes. For me this was a somewhat disturbing part of the tour, as the employee was referred to as a generic "picker", despite clearly being within audible range. The picker also didn't stop picking up and depositing items for the ~4 minutes the camera was focused on her.

As expected, Amazon's algorithm-driven logistics beast defines in minute detail what the picker needs to do. It will visually highlight the shelf they need to pick an item from, then which box it should then be deposited in. And repeat. Again and again.

Our tour guide was careful to emphasise how the entire station was built to be as ergonomic as possible, and are "always improving with feedback from pickers", however I'm pretty sure this setup is identical worldwide and doesn't change. Images are [available online](https://www.arkansasonline.com/photos/galleries/2021/nov/07/new-amazon-warehouse-little-rock/#images-13), picking stations are essentially just robot-driven shelves on the left, depositing boxes in front!

Once the depositing boxes ("totes") are full, they are pushed forward onto a conveyer belt for the next section: Pack.

### Pack

Next up, a few minutes at the packing station with "Riyadh" where these boxes of items get turned into envelopes of items!

The packing stations are pretty simple, with totes of items coming in on the left, various envelope sizes in front, and of course a screen guiding the packer with exactly which envelope is needed. I didn't want to include any of the employees here, so unfortunately only have a low quality cropped image of the packing station:

[![](/assets/images/2023/amazon-pack.png)](/assets/images/2023/amazon-pack.png)

This was an opportune moment for our tour guide to discuss sustainability. Personally I recycle all my Amazon packaging (or use it for home composting), and it is genuinely impressive how little plastic they use (none?). Amazon is apparently aiming for [net-zero carbon emissions by 2040](https://sustainability.aboutamazon.co.uk/environment/the-climate-pledge), and packaging material is clearly a large part of this.

There's not too much surprising here, besides the clearly well-practiced efficiency of the packer! One interesting part is around customer data: no employees up to this stage have seen any customer information. This is obvious in retrospect, but at this point there is now a packaged item, yet no destination information whatsoever. Instead, each envelope has an "SP" barcode on it that uniquely identifies each package. As Amazon's system has already chosen which envelope size to use, and supplies these envelopes, it knows exactly which envelope contains which item. Clever!

Next up, getting this packaging information ready: *SLAM*.

### SLAM

The oddly named "SLAM" stands for **S**can **L**abel, **A**pply **M**anifest, AKA printing address labels.

In the images below, packages enter from the right, get scanned, have a label printed and applied, then exit on the left:

| Leaving SLAM | Applying manifest | Scanning label |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [![](/assets/images/2023/amazon-slam-3-thumbnail.png)](/assets/images/2023/amazon-slam-3.png) |  [![](/assets/images/2023/amazon-slam-2-thumbnail.png)](/assets/images/2023/amazon-slam-2.png) |  [![](/assets/images/2023/amazon-slam-1-thumbnail.png)](/assets/images/2023/amazon-slam-1.png) |

This step also includes checking the package's weight is correct, and performs some other final checks before the package enters the shipping network. Any issues here are sent to a dedicated problem-solving team, presumably to figure out the rare instances where packages get mixed up.

In the "Applying manifest" step above, one of the two arms is mid-stamp. Interestingly, it apparently applies the label without any physical contact! Instead, the label is attached to the end of the arm, which is lowered to just above the package itself before a small burst of air actually releases and applies the label.

### Ship

- 15:27 - 15:28: POV of parcel going through all the steps from start -> giant boxes for trucks.
- 15:28 - 15:32: "Ship": Parcels down conveyor belts "chutes". Shipping people move from bottom of chutes into large storage "cages", that then get moved into lorries that arrive at prearranged time. Then go to "sortation centre", then "delivery centre" (e.g. local logistics). 
- 15:32 - 15:34: Video about "extreme" deliveries to himalayas. Superheroes: Some wear capes, others deliver them. 

### Q&As 

- 15:20 - 15:27: Q&A (4-5) "Lot of AI help in place". 
- 15:34 - 15:42: More Q&A (4-5), 1m/24hr some centres.

Notes:


- 15:43: Done, exit survey

Joiners from india, canada, USA

AR = Amazon Robotics centre = handles the smaller packages! FRA3 etc are all clothing related. Fulfillment centres are all very similar, in terms of tech / appearance. Don't work all days, usually Mon-Sat.

Manchester distribution centre "MAN1" (man airport, building 1). Named after nearest airport.
