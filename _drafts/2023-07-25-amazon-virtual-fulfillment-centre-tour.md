Whilst scrolling Instagram recently, I saw a sponsored post to [tour an Amazon factory](https://www.amazontours.com/na/virtual). As someone who [uses Amazon heavily](https://jakelee.co.uk/analysing-my-amazon-purchases/), I was intrigued. This unfortunately turned out to just be a *virtual* tour, but I still decided to give it a go! And no, this isn't a sponsored post, I promise ðŸ˜…

The [booking a spot](#booking-a-spot) and [expectations](#expectations) parts of this article have been written before the actual tour.

## Booking a spot

First, here's the Instagram post that piqued my interest:

After booking a time that worked for me, I received a confirmation email. Interestingly, they seemed happy for the viewing link to be shared as widely as possible:

Looking at the [Amazon tours FAQs](https://help.amazontours.com/hc/en-us), it looks like [anyone can sign up for a tour](https://www.amazontours.com/na/virtual), so if you like what you see in this post, maybe take one yourself!

## Expectations

This section has been written after booking my tour, but before the actual event. I've intentionally avoided reading *anything* about the tour, so these expectations are likely to be very inaccurate!

So, let's be realistic: if Amazon is sponsoring the ability to view a virtual tour, I don't see why it would be anything less than a heavily scripted PR opportunity.

### The virtual tour

It's a half hour event, and based off my general experience with onboarding and user experience testing, I'm expecting something similar to:
* 5 minutes setting up, letting people check audio settings, misc delays.
* 10 minutes presentation / prerecorded video about Amazon the company, their goals, motivations, employees, etc. 
* 10 minutes live tour through one of the fulfilment centres, paying special attention to their automation, employee experience, and how it all relates to the customer. Potentially a semi-scripted conversation with a surprisingly upbeat and enthusiastic employee!
* 5 minutes wrap-up, request for feedback, perhaps a small Q&A session.

Given the flak that Amazon often receives for how employees are treated, and fake merchandise sometimes being listed as genuine, I suspect these will be the focus areas. As Amazon is a very automation-heavy company, I expect their warehouse layout processes to be promoted heavily, and regular use of the "AI" buzzword. 

Almost 8 years ago, I read [this BBC article about Amazon's algorithm reliance](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20150818-how-algorithms-run-amazons-warehouses), and their techniques have undoubtedly evolved since then. Additionally, the tour will be of their (presumably more advanced) US centre.

### The fulfilment centre

I'm actually not sure what the inside of a fulfilment centre will look like. I do have a few preconceived notions of an extremely carefully organised and well lit large warehouse, with robots performing almost all the actual work. As this is the "public" image of these warehouses, I expect the cleanliness, lighting, and spaciousness to be somewhat better than the average centre.

### Interactivity

I strongly doubt there will be *any* part of the tour that is actually interactive.

Given that this is a controlled PR opportunity, I don't see why those attending will have any ability to communicate with each other / the organisers, besides perhaps a (curated) Q&A session. I also doubt I'll be able to see any information about how many people are attending, which is very understandable, but it would be nice to know if I'm part of a group of 10 or 1000!
