REDO INTRO

Every Christmas since 2011, one of my favourite content creators The Yogscast have organised the "Jingle Jam", a collection of streams with [an associated bundle](https://jinglejam.tiltify.com/) with TONS of great games to raise money for charity. This year, I'm trying to review all 80+ of them despite only playing 2-3 games all year before this! Here's part 2, with games 31-60. 

## Rating system

Before diving into the reviews, it's worth clarifying what these ratings mean. They *aren't* a typical game reviewer's "how good is this game", instead they are an entirely subjective "how much do I enjoy it". With that in mind, here's what the 5 ratings mean to me:

* **5/5**: I had to stop myself playing this game, this is a great game I'm very happy I've discovered.
* **4/5**: This was a good experience, but maybe a bit flawed. I'd still play this again, but maybe with not quite as much passion.
* **3/5**: The game was alright. Perhaps it had a few serious flaws, or had decisions made during development that make no sense. I probably wouldn't play these again, but might look at new games from the developer.
* **2/5**: I didn't enjoy the game. Maybe it has a few redeeming characteristics, but there's pretty much a 0% chance I'll ever pick this up again.
* **1/5**: The game experience was actively unpleasant. I had to force myself to play more than a few minutes of it, and was relieved when I finally closed the game. 

I aimed to play most of the games for around an hour, but many were small and understood after 15-20 minutes. Information on peak player count are [from SteamDB.info](https://steamdb.info/).

Finally, if you [purchase the bundle](https://jinglejam.tiltify.com/) you'll be sent an email with a long list of game keys. These can be entered manually into Steam (what I did, takes a while!), or [third party tools](https://jinglejam.tiltify.com/) can be used to speed up the process.

## 5/5 Games

### Lost Nova

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [86.44% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1603410/) | Â£11.39 | Adventure | May 2022 | 130 (May 2012) |

This reminds me of [Turnip Boy](https://jakelee.co.uk/reviewing-every-jingle-jam-steam-game/#turnip-boy-commits-tax-evasion) from the previous post, but with a lot more complexity and gameplay. In Lost Nova, you spend your time helping various people with their quests, whilst farming resources for upgrades to your broken ship as you go. You'll be using your laser to destroy obstacles, jump distances, and solve puzzles.

The same currency is used for almost all purchases, forcing you to choose between immediately helpful upgrades (e.g., extra energy), story progression (e.g., a ship part), or convenience (e.g., a shortcut). There's also plenty of replayable quests such as hunting down a bear's lost kids that ensure it's always possible to get more currency if you need it.

I played for around 90 minutes, and unfortunately experienced a bug where I became stuck in a rock and couldn't jump out. Before this I hadn't experienced any problems, and the movement and gathering mechanics felt very smooth. Finally, I'd like to compliment the dialog, which was entertaining, just detailed enough to provide the necessary context, and skippable.
