REDO INTRO

Every Christmas since 2011, one of my favourite content creators The Yogscast have organised the "Jingle Jam", a collection of streams with [an associated bundle](https://jinglejam.tiltify.com/) with TONS of great games to raise money for charity. This year, I'm trying to review all 80+ of them despite only playing 2-3 games all year before this! Here's part 2, with games 31-60. 

## Rating system

Before diving into the reviews, it's worth clarifying what these ratings mean. They *aren't* a typical game reviewer's "how good is this game", instead they are an entirely subjective "how much do I enjoy it". With that in mind, here's what the 5 ratings mean to me:

* **5/5**: I had to stop myself playing this game, this is a great game I'm very happy I've discovered.
* **4/5**: This was a good experience, but maybe a bit flawed. I'd still play this again, but maybe with not quite as much passion.
* **3/5**: The game was alright. Perhaps it had a few serious flaws, or had decisions made during development that make no sense. I probably wouldn't play these again, but might look at new games from the developer.
* **2/5**: I didn't enjoy the game. Maybe it has a few redeeming characteristics, but there's pretty much a 0% chance I'll ever pick this up again.
* **1/5**: The game experience was actively unpleasant. I had to force myself to play more than a few minutes of it, and was relieved when I finally closed the game. 

I aimed to play most of the games for around an hour, but many were small and understood after 15-20 minutes. Information on peak player count are [from SteamDB.info](https://steamdb.info/).

Finally, if you [purchase the bundle](https://jinglejam.tiltify.com/) you'll be sent an email with a long list of game keys. These can be entered manually into Steam (what I did, takes a while!), or [third party tools](https://jinglejam.tiltify.com/) can be used to speed up the process.

## 5/5 Games

### Lost Nova

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [86.44% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1603410/) | £11.39 | Adventure | May 2022 | 130 (May 2012) |

This reminds me of [Turnip Boy](https://jakelee.co.uk/reviewing-every-jingle-jam-steam-game/#turnip-boy-commits-tax-evasion) from the previous post, but with a lot more complexity and gameplay. In Lost Nova, you spend your time helping various people with their quests, whilst farming resources for upgrades to your broken ship as you go. You'll be using your laser to destroy obstacles, jump distances, and solve puzzles.

The same currency is used for almost all purchases, forcing you to choose between immediately helpful upgrades (e.g., extra energy), story progression (e.g., a ship part), or convenience (e.g., a shortcut). There's also plenty of replayable quests such as hunting down a bear's lost kids that ensure it's always possible to get more currency if you need it.

I played for around 90 minutes, and unfortunately experienced a bug where I became stuck in a rock and couldn't jump out. Before this I hadn't experienced any problems, and the movement and gathering mechanics felt very smooth. Finally, I'd like to compliment the dialog, which was entertaining, just detailed enough to provide the necessary context, and skippable.

## 4/5

### Bonfire Peaks

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [87.70% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1147890/) | £15.49 | Puzzle | September 2021 | 57 (October 2021) |

This is a just a very solid puzzler. Each level you need to get your box of belongings into the fire (don't ask), with this usually requiring climbing up a few levels. Of course, if your box is in front of you, you can't climb moving forward, hence the complexity.

To get around this, you'll spend most of your time rotating yourself and your box and shuffling crates around to make your way up to the fire. The difficulty ramps up gradually, with all the puzzles hitting that perfect sweet spot of requiring some thought, but always feeling possible. Due to this excellent game designs, I'm pretty sure I'll be coming back to this once my brain has recharged a bit!

### Moon Hunters

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [76.91% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/320040/) | £1.13 | Roguelite | March 2016 | 324 (February 2017) |

I only did 1 run of this RPG / roguelite, but got hints of a much, much bigger world with far more complexity. The combat was challenging, but it never felt unfair or unbalanced. It was always a matter of balancing the abilities against their energy cost and effect on movement. The story went over my head a little bit, but I could easily see myself giving this a few more runs to try out the different classes, and the new cosmetics / features unlocked after each run.

Most of the negative reviews mention low replayability, and an almost requirement of multiplayer for later levels. Whilst those do sounds like major downsides, I didn't get that far!

### Maiden & Spell

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [91.02% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1004770/) | £10.29 | Bullet Hell | February 2020 | 130 (February 2022) |

Whilst the overall design of this game definitely isn't my thing ("magical girl battle game, set in a cutesy fantasy world"), the gameplay here is an engaging iteration of the bullet hell genre. 

I played this on keyboard, and holding down "Z" for the main attack the entire game felt a bit pointless. The additional attacks were somewhat awkward to activate, with the keys being Shift, Z, X, C, and V. These are not easy to press reliably! I frequently pressed the wrong attack, dodging when I wanted to do a strong attack and vice versa.

The story was very much not my thing, but ignoring it and the aesthetic reveals a pretty good bullet hell game underneath. Finally, most of the other reviews focused on the apparently great online multiplayer mode, which I imagine has an absurdly high skill ceiling! I only played the offline story mode.

## 3/5

### Lucifer Within Us

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [73.66% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/717560/) | £7.49 | Mystery | October 2020 | 90 (October 2020) |

Lucifer Within Us was quite unlike other detective / mystery games I've played, in that it really was almost entirely about the evidence and any contradictions, instead of interrogation minigames etc. The core gameplay is focused around a timeline, as told by all potential suspects. Elements of this can then be investigated, and compared to other suspects' testimonies.

Whilst I did like the mostly mental challenge behind the investigation, some elements were too unpredictable or unknowable. For example, at several points during the investigation I got stuck, until eventually I discovered the character's "psyche" needed to be clicked on, to gain an insight into their mind. This could then be used as part of the investigation process. This very game-y element took away from the usually logic based challenge, but wasn't a major issue.

Overall the replayability is pretty much zero, and whilst the story is somewhat interesting there is not much motivation to continue investigating murders. The supernatural / demonic possession elements feel a little out of place, and I'd be interested in this gameplay style in a more contemporary setting.

### Absolute Drift

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [84.95% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/320140/) | £2.69 | Driving | July 2015 | 352 (June 2016) |

This is a tricky game to review. If you like drifting a car through (mostly) 2D environments then this is *the* game for you. If you want anything else, it doesn't have it.

The controls are pretty simple if you've done much drifting in other games, it'll be the usual mix of feathering the throttle and careful steering. "Free play" is definitely the mode to play, with the tutorial and all progression being shown in a gradual and natural manner. Overall it's a pretty simple game, but implemented well.

### Men of War: Assault Squad 2

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [89.21% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/244450/) | £19.99 | Strategy | May 2014 | 9.7k (March 2015) |

This is another one of those games that (at least based on reviews) is probably pretty good, but so far outside of my interest zone that it's impossible for me to rate it highly.

Playing this game was a bit of a trial by fire, with no tutorial on movement, unit selection, etc. I think I figured the basics out after a little bit of confusion over right / left clicking, but throughout the tutorial mission I never had much control or confidence in my actions.

The unit AI seemed pretty creative, with troop movement offering various options for taking decent firing positions, and troops covering each other automatically if they came under fire. Overall, it's a popular game but I'm not into RTS!

### Orbi Universo

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [73.28% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1090670/) | £16.75 | Strategy | January 2020 | 256 (December 2022) |

Orbi Universo is not a game for those easily overwhelmed. Similar to strategy games like the Democracy series, your goal is to grow your civilisation via various "levers", whilst preventing anything catastrophic happening. For me, I ran out of money, panic-collapsed my entire civilisation to prevent civil unrest, and the resulting instability resulted in total societal collapse. Oops!

This is a very, very hard game to keep track of. Whilst you can organise your "bubbles" into groups, all the bubbles try to auto-position themselves that quickly results in an overlapping mess of bubbles, all influencing each other. For example, I found "Population" connected to many bubbles, so it was impossible to not have it surrounded by a mess of overlapping cables.

Luckily, mousing over your coins, political capital, or any attribute will show what affects it. Of course, due to the complex interactions between all the elements, it's still pretty hard to actually fix anything that is wrong. Additionally, the tutorial ends a bit too early for my liking, it would be good if it walked you through a bit more of the societal balancing aspect, not just the basic controls.

Whilst I enjoyed my brief time with Orbi Universo, I spent most of it in a confused and overwhelmed state, mostly due to the user interface. There's probably a good game hiding in there somewhere!

### Plague Inc: Evolved

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [92.72% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/246620/) | £4.07 | Strategy | February 2016 | 17.8k (January 2020) |

No prizes for figuring out why this pandemic simulator has been popular the last few years!

I played a fair amount of similar games back on Kongregate ~15 years ago, and perhaps that burnout was partially why I wasn't as impressed by Plague Inc as most other reviewers. The gameplay is very simple, click bubbles that appear on the map to earn points to upgrade your disease. Whilst there is a balance between infectivity and lethality, the strategy is very, very simple.

The outcomes of games felt fairly random, with the gameplay almost feeling like a sandbox that I was only slightly influencing at times. Whilst the game is very polished, and has an impressive amount of gameplay variants and achievements, the core gameplay is very repetitive.

Plague Inc might be fun for a few hours if you can include the slightly too-close-to-home subject matter, but ultimately it's a bit too shallow to become a long-term game.

## 2/5

### Aeronautica Imperialis: Flight Command

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [46.41% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/610160/Aeronautica_Imperialis_Flight_Command/) | £1.89 | Strategy | May 2020 | 142 (May 2020) |

This is a rough game, with a very early-access feel. UIs are very basic, and there's no voice acting or sounds leading to creepily quiet air battles. These are usually quite noisy environments! There are no cinematics, and the UI impressively stutters on simple tasks like assigning a new pilot attribute.

I didn't realise this was a Warhammer 40k game until I read Steam reviews, nor did I realise it was based on a tabletop game which explains some odd elements of the gameplay. For example, planes will often intersect each other completely when performing moves, with no physics interaction.

The post-move camera is a bit of a mess, with quick cuts all over the place. There is a way to view the entire move from a static position, but this preference resets after every turn! Same with boundary visibility, targeting arcs, etc. Finally, the tutorial was longer than it needed to be, whilst explaining very little. 

Unfortunately not much fun.

### Mad Experiments: Escape Room

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [70.52% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1201550/) | £9.68 | Puzzle | November 2020 | 58 (July 2020) |

Getting it out of the way upfront, I'm not a fan of escape rooms. I played this room alone, and perhaps having other players around would have made it a bit easier. As it was however, it was a frustrating experience of blundering around, occasionally finding something unexpected, then blundering around until I worked out what to do with this information.

The game itself only consists of 3 escape rooms, with zero real replayability (the solution is always the same). Whilst there is DLC, it only consists of cosmetics masks and a soundtrack, instead of any actual new rooms.

There are plenty of escape room games, and it's the kind of genre that from my experience loses too much when translated into a game. I'd recommend a VR solution over this, or the real thing ideally!

### Mech Mechanic Simulator

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [65.82% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1044980/) | £16.99 | Simulator | March 2021 | 609 (March 2021) |

This is a pretty simple game. Accept a job, take off mech part, take it apart, replace faulty parts, put back together, and repeat.

Whilst mech part repair does open up later on (instead of just replacement), there's really not enough here to justify the work required. Navigating the repair shop is a chore (no jumping barriers, no sprinting, etc), and the actual gameplay is mostly annoying without any challenge. You'll just be clicking the green parts until you can access the one you need to replace. That's it.

I can't really recommend this unfortunately, some kind of overarching story would be a great way to improve this. Any element of a sideplot or subplot would have helped.

## 1/5

### Big Crown Showdown

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [63.88% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/793360/) | £9.99 | Multiplayer | December 2018 | 8 (December 2022) |

This is a multiplayer only game that seems to have no servers, and has never had more than 8 players online at once.

I tried every menu option to try and actually play the game, and eventually had to just add myself twice to the party (keyboard + mouse) and play an offline custom game. The levels were pretty simple, and there was no challenge to complete them, so I started controlling 2 characters at once just to try to have some fun. I actually initially thought the levels were procedurally generated, but no, they just use the same few assets repeatedly. 

As a far more minor complaint than the whole "there's no game to play", there are zero(!) cosmetic options available on first launch, despite a whole shop full of hats that can be purchased. 

If you have someone sitting next to you, maybe you can find some fun here. I couldn't.
