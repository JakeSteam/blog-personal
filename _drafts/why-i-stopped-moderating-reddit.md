Back in 2017, I was just getting into Android development and spent a lot of time moderating Android-related subreddits. This was a good way to keep myself busy and give back, but 5 years later I... don't moderate anything. Ever. I wanted to dive into why I lost all motivation, as a warning to others!

Just to get it out of the way, I am fully aware internet moderation is essentially unpaid labour, and often an excuse to power trip. I promise I'll get on to both of those points later! 

## Moderation timeline

* Mid 2016: Created /r/PixelBlacksmith to promote my game.
* Early 2017: Added to /r/AndroidGaming and /r/AndroidApps mod teams.
* Mid 2017: Added to /r/Android, /r/AndroidQuestions, and /r/PlayMyGame mod teams.
* Late 2018: Added to /r/AndroidDev mod team.
* Mid 2019: Took ownership of /r/AndroidDev.
* Early 2020: Lost all interest, stopped actively moderating.

## Motivation

Ultimately, I do a lot of things online primarily to help others. It's why I write blog posts, it's why I started moderating, and it's what I enjoy doing. However, some of the people I moderated with had very different motivations. 

Instead of wanting to help others, they wanted to have power and control over people or the communities they're in. Whilst these goals sometimes aligned (e.g. combating spammers), they would frequently cause conflict when discussing rule changes, actions to take, etc.

If you're a moderator in a community right now and wondering if your colleagues are after power or want to help others, a great indicator is the way they refer to users. If it's with some sort of insult, they're not trying to help. After I'd started moderating larger subreddits for a year or so, I noticed my own motivation changing. Instead of trying to improve communities I was...

## Empire building

* Inspired by others, but took it too far

## Reddit the corporation

* Disconnected
* Changes don't reflect non-main subs

## Moderating the masses vs individuals

* Moderating discord / clan chats v different to forums
* Actively participating vs just seeing it as a mod
