I recently went to Japan for an unbelievably excellent 3-week holiday! Here's the final part of the trip, Tokyo (again), told via 23 Google Maps reviews.

_Note: This is a series of posts, with Tokyo [Part 1](/japan-part-1-tokyo/), Takayama [Part 2](/japan-part-2-takayama), Kyoto [Part 3](/japan-part-3-kyoto/) and [Part 4](/japan-part-4-kyoto), and Tokyo again (this article)._

## Day 1 (7th September): Arrival

We arrived from Kyoto around lunchtime, still managing to have a busy afternoon and evening! A total of **13,730 steps (5.68 miles)**.

### Shibuya Excel Tower ★★★★✰

A decent business-y hotel overlooking Shibuya Scramble, with some annoyances. We selected the high floor corner room specifically for the views, and luckily it didn't disappoint! Watching the rush at all hours was easily the highlight. However, it was a bit of a shame the windows, the main selling point, were inexplicably not properly cleaned and had grease smears from previous guests.

Entering the hotel directly from the station is quite challenging, make sure to follow the detailed guide on the hotel's site. Alternatively, it's far easier to just find "Shibuya Mark City", and look for the direct entrance on the street level. This will take you up to the lobby, where you can change elevators to get to your actual room.

Breakfast was fairly good, although seemed pretty crowded no matter what time we went, and having a long central table meant reaching past people occasionally. There is a fresh pancake machine which works well, other than that it's all pretty typical breakfast buffet offerings and very western overall. Tasty, but nothing too surprising.

The laundry situation was also unusual, with 1 unmentioned washing machine and dryer on SOME floors, I believe 7 - 11 or so. This meant taking the lift multiple times to try and find an empty machine, and then repeating the process for the dryer. Both machines only accepted 100 Yen coins, yet there was no change machine. There were some small vending machines... but they didn't take new 500 Yen coins! All in all, laundry was very inconvenient.

### Tokyo Tower ★★★★★

Absolutely stunning views of Tokyo, especially at sunset!

We paid for the upper floor, and it's well worth the extra cost and should be booked in advance. The main floor is a little crowded, and features a cramped shop and various brand-related events. This whole area becomes pitch black at night, with glass or glow-in-the-dark floor areas, and is overall a great way to experience the area.

However, if you have a time-slot for the additional floor you can line up at another elevator (note your time STARTS at the time listed, not "must arrive by" as the email says!) to go higher. This includes a brief promotional video, a professional photo (printed on a small promotional leaflet as you leave), a small drink, but most importantly a mirror-filled observation deck.

From this deck you can see miles and miles in all directions, with the city's drastic appearance change during sunset providing a unique perspective. Whilst it can be quite crowded, people typically move on after taking their selfies so you can stare in peace. It's even possible to see mt fuji sometimes!

Upon exiting there's a strange small mall at the base, selling various mementos and snacks, with the exit hidden away and requiring careful sign following.

### teamLab Borderless ★★★★✰

As one of the most Instagram-y places in Tokyo, this is obviously a place where aesthetics and visuals are prioritised above all else! Make sure to book in advance, as it can get busy at all hours on a weekend.

A free-flowing, dark, and fluid space with various rooms and corridors, this museum often feels like an accidental maze. Each room or area has unique exhibits moving across the walls and floor, with many of them actually migrating between areas. This means you might see a pretty school of fish swim away, then come across them a room or two later unexpectedly.

This effect is limited however, with most rooms having more of a looping cast of artworks. These are typically nature-based, such as fish, water, or flowers, although there's good variety such as some corridors feature bizarre walking animations.

The space itself is dark throughout, although the layout is only confusing the first time you enter. After being in a room once, it's fairly simple to figure out which other rooms are nearby and make your way there. The rooms by themselves vary in quality, with my favourites (typically the most otherworldly) often hidden away in side corridors, such as the "water lily" style room or vertically strobing lights. Other rooms feature mysterious balls rolling round, or large cubes in a completely dark room.

Overall it's definitely worth visiting once, although if you visit in the evening the entrance in the basement of the mall can be hard to find! The mall itself seems empty, yet an open door leads to an escalator taking you to the correct location.

### Yakitori Tsukada ★★★★★

A high-end yakitori restaurant offering a tasting menu of 10 or so dishes. All members of a group need to order the same menu, as they are served at the same time along with an explanation of what they are. We went for the "standard course" (Y4800 each), and it filled us up, but everything was so tasty I wish we'd gone for the premium!

Each course is unique, although unsurprisingly they are mostly chicken with something, however each is served so differently that it's easy to forget there's primarily one type of meat here. Courses are timed well, so there's enough time for your group to talk about each dish and chat before the next one arrives, to avoid becoming overwhelmed.

Almost all cooking is done in front of you, including the occasional large fireballs! There's a low level of conversation, but everyone was upbeat, I'd definitely recommend sitting at the counter not the larger tables. We had the matcha tiramisu at the end, a perfect dessert for two to share and finish the meal.

Overall the price was high, but we got what we paid for, clearly being the best chicken either of us have ever had. Even a dish as simple as a fried chicken wing somehow evolves through the cooking technique and seasoning! Pictured is a tsukimi tsukune.
