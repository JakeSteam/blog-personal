## Update on previous games

What happened to the 4 games I loved a few weeks ago, that I [wrote positive reviews about in a previous post](/sept-android-game-reviews/)?

### Knights of San Francisco

**Uninstalled at 1 completion.**

As mentioned in my review, I felt my single playthrough experienced the majority of the game, so decided not to do further playthroughs to go for 100% completion.

### .projekt

**Still installed.**

I'm still enjoying .projekt, and it's nice to play semi-brainlessly whilst listening to podcasts. Unfortunately the complexity hits a bit of a plateau, and it is no longer challenging 60 or so levels in.

I might end up 100% completing it, but it'll likely be a slow one.

### inbento

**Uninstalled around Chapter 7.**

Whilst this game was fun, I am too dumb. After a while, I was solving puzzles through trial and error and didn't feel any intellectual dopamine from finally getting there!

### red

**Uninstalled after completion.**

There's no reason to replay this game after 1 completion, so I didn't!
