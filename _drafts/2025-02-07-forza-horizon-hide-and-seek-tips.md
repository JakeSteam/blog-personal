intro

## What's the point

Well, for some completionists (me!) simply knowing there's content not "completed" is enough of an incentive. However, there's also a badge every 100 levels ([full guide](/complete-guide-to-forza-horizon-5-badges/)), plus the knowledge that only ~100 people have completed this grind even 5 months after release.

The game mode is also pretty generous with (overall) XP, so you'll gain hundreds of levels and wheelspins along the way. These will result in a few hundred million credits, I hit the maximum (999,999,999) around level 700.

## General tips

1. **Distance travelled is all that matters**: Chase breakers, hiders pinged, win or loss, none of it matters anywhere near as much as the distance travelled in a game.
2. **You want to drive as straight as possible, as fast as possible**: Straight is fast, and fast is far. This is why you ideally want to be [a hider](#hider-tips) (faster cars) on [Mulége](#mulége) (long highway).
3. **Avoid other players**: Whether you're a hider or a seeker, nothing positive comes from interacting with players on either team. As collision is enabled, bumping into a friendly hider can drastically reduce your XP, so give everyone plenty of space when overtaking.
4. **Ignore the game objectives, only the clock & distance matters**: Regardless of what the announcer says, you don't care about hunting down the hider, or reaching the objective as fast as possible. You're just driving as far as possible, for as long as possible.
5. **This is extremely time-consuming**: Level 1000 took me around 1500 games (including non-grind games, and instant finishes), totalling 100+ hours. Settle in, this will be painful.
6. **Level 1000 requires 15,000,000 XP**: At a maximum of around 20,000 XP per game, that's at least 750 games. You'll likely need twice that to account for hider rounds, bad maps, and early finishes.
7. **You get an XP boost for your streak, with a cap**: Make sure you never quit a game, since you'll lose XP on future matches. Instead, just wait out the timer. If you've queued up for a game accidentally, keep the pause menu open and you won't join.

## Seeker tips

6. **Usually drive the [2017 Nissan GT-R](<https://forza.fandom.com/wiki/Nissan_GT-R_(2017)>)**: This car has the fastest top speed, making it the best car for maps like Mulége.
7. **There are multiple other good choices**: You might prefer one of the other car choices, you've got hundreds of games to play so try them all! I'd recommend the [2016 Toyota Land Cruiser](https://forza.fandom.com/wiki/Toyota_Land_Cruiser_Arctic_Trucks_AT37) if you want to skip more corners, or [2012 Lamborghini Spyder](https://forza.fandom.com/wiki/Lamborghini_Gallardo_LP570-4_Spyder_Performante) / [2011 Mercedez-Benz SLS AMG](https://forza.fandom.com/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_SLS_AMG) if you want fancier ride. Try them out, and find your preferred handling. They're all reasonable choices, except the useless [2016 Ariel Nomad](https://forza.fandom.com/wiki/Ariel_Nomad).
8. **On Guanajuato, drive the [2008 Mitsubishi Lancer GSR](https://forza.fandom.com/wiki/Mitsubishi_Lancer_Evolution_X_GSR)**: It has slightly better handling whilst still being fast, making it better at navigating the narrow crowded streets. However, as before, most cars (except the Ariel Nomad) are good here, with top speed not being as important. The Lamborghini Spyder is very good.
9. **Corner safely, not max speed**: Since you lose so much speed by hitting street furniture (e.g. edges of buildings on Playa Azul),

## Boredom tips

1. **You don't need to pay that much attention, especially on Mulége**: After grinding each map 10+ times, you'll likely know it pretty well. As such, I was usually watching movies on my other monitor throughout. An audiobook or podcast is also a good option, whatever you need to keep driving the same line over and over!
2. **Mix it up for your own sanity**: Whilst I do recommend doing a high-speed 180 at each end of a run and bouncing off the barrier, other techniques like slowing and turning, or driving a large loop, are pretty similar and give you _something_ to look forward to.
3. **Use fun quick-chats ([Forza Link](https://forza.fandom.com/wiki/Forza_Horizon_5/Forza_LINK))**: This is a pretty solitary grind for most people, so even a tiny bit of interaction in the form of Forza Link phrases can help. Phrases with quick responses such as [Colin McRae's quote](https://x.com/GoodwoodRRC/status/1820414939732828517) "Straight roads are for fast cars" and reply "and turns are for fast drivers" are fun to find.
