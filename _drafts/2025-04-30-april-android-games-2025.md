## #1: [Pondlife](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.runawayplay.fishgame)

This is not a challenging game. It's not even a particularly engaging game. However, it is a lovely way to spend a relaxing minute or two every half hour or so, and sometimes that's all you want!

### Review

Pondlife is, unsurprisingly, about building a pond. You'll spend your time creating fish and other pond creatures to grow, feeding them every now and again, then eventually releasing them into the wild and getting new creatures.

These creatures are organised into categories (so far I have "Glitter Fish", "Lily Hopper", and "Cleaner Fish"), each requiring their own type of food. This food is typically purchased with bubbles, the main game currency, which can be acquired over time from plants and decorations.

This creature creation, feeding, and releasing forms the main gameplay loop. It all happens at a very relaxed pace, with intervals of 30+ minutes between feeding sessions for larger fish being common. Smaller fish, like the starter few fishes, will only take a minute or so, enabling a more active form of gameplay.

Progression comes in the form of XP and levels, with new levels unlocking new areas of the pond. Almost every action rewards XP, and the first few are pretty speedy.

On this topic, the game does a good job of letting you choose your own play style. If you intend to play actively, then selecting fast maturing plants and fast-growing fish will reward more engagement. If however you're more like me and only want to interact with your pond occasionally, slower growing but higher yield choices will make more sense.

Something I really appreciated about Pondlife is no incentive for keeping the game open. For example, if you carefully plan your pond so everything takes about half hour, there's no benefit whatsoever to keeping the app open all that time. Instead, you can close it, come back at the right time, and everything will be ready for you! There's also no prestigem echanic, or income multipliers, just slowly making your pond better.

Whilst it is ultimately a fairly simple game, there are a few extras that make it engaging. For example, there's a quest system providing objectives ranging from releasing enough of a certain fish to nudging different fish into each other (via slowly dragging your finger to guide them). These quests help provide a hint on the next thing to do, but are fairly optional with helpful but not essential rewards.

Releasing enough of a specific creature will unlock the next creature in the category, as well as providing more information about the size, location, and Latin name. I really like how releasing enough of an animal to progress up through the 3 categories is framed as helping to repopulate, progressing from "Discovered", to "Established", and finally "Thriving". Removing fish by "releasing" them into the wild is much, much more wholesome than "selling" or "removing".

Similarly, there's some really nice touches by the developers, showing there's some effort put in. If you have multiple of the same fish, they will form groups and swim together, whilst frogs will sometimes hop up on the logs poking out of your pond. These effects are entirely aesthetic, but add more life to the pond.

Finally, there also seems to be regularly seasonal events. My time with the game overlapped with a 2 week "Treasure Fish" event, essentially a whole new category of fish with their own food that grow in your pond. Nurturing and releasing enough of these fish provide "main game" rewards, and I actually engaged with the event more than the main game due to the pretty fish!

### Monetisation

There's the usual mixture of monetisation methods, with various packs, XP boosters, and aquacash (premium currency) packs, alongside incentivised adverts.

Luckily these aren't too aggressive, or mandatory. I purchased one of the cheaper starter packs early on to support the developer, and it provided a jumpstart to reduce my feeding costs, but a couple of days later the benefit was essentially nullified. Similarly, the adverts aren't particularly rewarding, typically giving a low level reward or skipping a single fish's timer.

### Tips

- Aquacash should probably only be used to upgrade your feeding station, since that can't be upgraded any other way and provides constant benefits.
- Following quests is a good way to get extra XP and unlock new areas, so keep an eye on them.
- Make sure your pond is always full, so you're not wasting capacity.
- Merging decorations to make the rarer ones more powerful is useful, letting you quickly collect large amounts of bubbles.
- Getting a creature to the next "level" typically rewards well, so it's worth picking creatures carefully.
- Having a balance of animals that eat expensive (e.g. Cleaner Fish, ~100 bubbles) and cheap (e.g. Glitter Fish, ~10 bubbles) food is essential, or you'll run out of bubbles and be unable to feed them!
