Chase is a relatively new addition to the UK banking market, and is backed by JP Morgan. They offer an app-only current account with cashback and a linked savings account, however there is only a manual switch process. Here's why & how I switched, and my experience with the process.

As a disclaimer, whilst this is totally unsponsored, all of this is just *my personal experience*. Obviously it doesn't constitute financial advice, do proper research on sites like [MoneySavingExpert](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/) or [Money to the masses](https://moneytothemasses.com/banking/chase-bank-review-is-it-the-best-uk-digital-bank) before making financial decisions, don't rely on random articles like this!

## Background context

I opened my Chase current & savings account in early 2022, primarily to use their card abroad without any transaction fees. Since then, their instant access savings rate had steadily risen, so I ended up using it as my main savings. In addition, their daily cashback was reliable and generous, so using Chase for almost all transactions made sense. This cashback was [recently changed to be a permanent benefit](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/news/2023/02/chase-cashback-changes/).

Once I was using Chase for savings AND day to day spending, it didn't make much sense to have my main current account with a typical high street bank!

However, Chase are not part of the UK [current account switch service](https://www.currentaccountswitch.co.uk/) that almost all banks are a part of. This service ensures a hassle-free and smooth transition between current accounts, so Chase not being a part of it made me avoid switching for a few months. In April, with my house move completed, I finally decided to go through the [hassle of switching via a paper form](https://www.chase.co.uk/gb/en/support/switching-to-chase/).

## Switch timeline

* 25th April: Switch form posted
* 26th April: Form collected by Royal Mail
* 15th May: Intended switch date


## Why I switched

As mentioned, I originally switched for the international usage, and the 1-year (now permanent!) promotional perk of 1% cashback. However, that wasn't the only reason:

### Financial

* No account fee.
* The Chase current account has 1% interest, so my day-to-day money will be earning a bit.
* There is 1% cash-back on spending (up to £15), the most any current account offers.
* Chase has a "Round-up" feature, where transactions get rounded up to the nearest whole £, and the difference put into an account that earns 5% interest(!).
* The Chase savings account has 3.1% interest, and is regularly increasing.

### App

* Compared to the high street bank app I've had to use for a few years, the app is extremely sleek and user-friendly.
* The design is very appealing to me personally ([more info](https://khaledshaaban.com/posts/chase-uk-app-onboarding)), being white with blue highlights (my favourite colours!). 
* All information is clearly laid out, and the key information (card details, current balance, transaction history) is immediately available and clear.
* When I open the app, once I've used my fingerprint there's no pointless popups / reminders / adverts, just an account overview.
* You can add custom notes to payments, useful for things like Paypal purchases that won't show details, or ones where the company name is unexpected (e.g. a small market stall might have a generic payment provider name).
* Company logos are added automatically where possible, e.g. Amazon / Sainsbury's / Deliveroo.

### Misc

* The communications are useful, and reasonable. My former bank would regularly send me emails with obvious scam prevention tips, banal advice about shopping online, and similarly pointless topics, despite having all email preferences turned off. Instead, Chase emails me actual useful information, usually about an increase in interest rates!
* The Chase card has no international fees, and worked perfectly when I travelled in Europe & US recently.
* The card itself matches the branding (and my aesthetic taste!) well, being a solid blue colour:

### Downsides

Whilst I obviously really like the account, it isn't perfect. Here are the issues I've experienced in the last year or so:
* Last year the app had a bug that broke logging in, and I needed to clear the app cache to fix it. 
* The card is Mastercard, but debit, causing 1-2 online retailers to not quite understand how it works and fail to charge it.
* There's no overdraft, which I prefer having just in case.
* As an app-only account, there are no cheque / cash deposits. Not an issue for me personally, but I can see how it could be a deal breaker.
* The account [can't send / receive money internationally](https://www.chase.co.uk/gb/en/support/international-payments/), this is the main reason I'm still intending to keep my old bank account open after the switch.

## Conclusion
