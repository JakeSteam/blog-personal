The last couple of months have seen a lot less time spent mobile gaming, mostly due to r/incremental_games [temporarily shutting down](https://www.reddit.com/r/incremental_games/comments/14dkm2l/rincremental_games_mod_update/). Despite that, I've still had a great time with a few games, with only one of them being an incremental / idle game this time!

The games are in descending order of "fun", and might contain mild spoilers:

## #1: [Slitherlink](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ejelta.slitherlink.ads)

I have never hated and loved a game as much as Slitherlink. It is the most obnoxiously hard yet rewarding puzzle game I have ever played, and if I had to take a single game onto a desert island for the rest of my life it just might be this.

### Review

Slitherlink is extremely simple to learn, yet impossible to master. All you need to do is form a single unbroken "loop" throughout a game map made up if squares / hexagons / other shapes, with some squares having a specific number of edges filled in.

These simple rules, explained through an excellent tutorial, will leave you finishing the first level and wondering how this can be challenging. Then you try an actual puzzle and... your brain melts. I've spent hundreds of hours playing Minesweeper, Loops of Zen, and Nonogram games, and Slitherlink is a combination of the best elements of all of these.

There are 6 free choices of board style: Honeycomb, Snowflakes, Squares, Cairo, Kites, and Diagonals. Each of these has the same "create a loop" idea, but the difference in shapes requires completely different strategies for each. Whilst the "Easy" levels are generally fairly solvable, even "Normal" will mean repeatedly spending multiple minutes staring at the board before making a move! Considering the "Small" size will still take a few minutes, the ability of 3 larger board sizes is only for those who truly want to give themselves a headache!

Personally I can only complete small size & normal difficulty, or medium size & easy difficulty on most board styles. Eventually I'm intending to work my way up to huge size & hard difficulty, but the skill required for that is far beyond my current ability!

In terms of app design, it reminds me of [Wordiest](https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidGaming/comments/5yq12w/wordiest_the_only_word_game_on_android_i_keep/) (which is no longer on the store), with an extremely simple yet functional interface. It also has a similarly abstracted "multiplayer", where the average solve time is shown once you complete a puzzle. I'm yet to beat this average, which should indicate my limited ability so far! It's also worth pointing out that you can pinch to zoom / pan, absolutely essential for larger maps and helpful even on the smaller ones.

Finally, there's also a good level of customisation, letting you fine tune the puzzle solving to avoid time spent fighting the interface so you can focus on the puzzle itself. The default settings were fine for me (besides enabling dark mode), but I might give them all a closer link when I'm more aware of what works for me. 

In summary, Slitherlink will make you feel like an absolute idiot for minutes at a time, as you stare at a supposedly "easy" puzzle that is clearly defeating you. However, when you finally logically deduce the line that can be filled in? You'll feel like an absolute genius, and the intellectual dopamine rush is unrivalled.

### Monetisation

There's none! 

It's free, ad-free, and you can't donate money even if you wanted to! The dev (Ejelta) has made no other games besides a tech demo from over a decade ago, and [their website](https://ejelta.com/) suggests mobile development is very much a hobby project.

### Tips

It's very hard to give tips for Slitherlink, since every board type plays quite differently. However, there are a few common threads:
* As the tutorial suggests, learning patterns is extremely powerful. Once you've solved a scenario once, recognising it the next time it comes out will save you minutes.
* Don't gamble. Just like Minesweeper, only draw a line if you are *certain*, or it might ruin your whole game!
* There is a checkpoint system, so you can "guess" if stuck between two options. However, I personally don't use this, since the mistake might not be realised until many minutes of later, and the time waste is too painful.
* Each puzzle has a single solution. If a tile seems to have multiple solutions, you need to solve something else first.

## Conclusion

Overall, only 2 of these are idle games, with SpinCraft being more of a roguelike. The idle games also both fall into the common trap of not quite having enough content, which is honestly a real shame for great games like Power Inc. 

I'll be sticking around on the Discord / Subreddit for these games to keep an eye out for future updates, I really hope to see them expanded much more in the future! Power Inc definitely has a ton of potential.
