intro

The games are in descending order of "fun", and might contain mild spoilers:

## #1: [Dice Tycoon](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.genetix.dicetycoon)

Dice Tycoon is a dice-based incremental from the same developer as [Lone Tower](/june-july-android-game-reviews/#3-lone-tower).

### Review

I'm a bit torn on reviewing this. I downloaded it within a few hours of release, due to a [ping on the developer's discord](https://discord.gg/5KRUUQXYn7). The Google Play Store even said 0 downloads! As such, this is a game very early in its life. However, it's not in early access, it's a full game, so needs to be judged as such.

Dice Tycoon has the _basics_ of a good game. But, it's not there yet.

Gameplay is just rolling dice, and picking a card to apply on each roll. You earn money that can be used on simple upgrades, or purchase bizarre "Collection" items. There's no complexity, and once you've got 30-40 cards built up you're just spam clicking.

The balance is particularly poor, with every roll earning you next to nothing, besides the occasional roll increasing your money 1000x. I'm not sure what's even causing this, since it sometimes happens without cards!

The collection images are also particularly bizarre. They're vaguely pixel art, but the sizes are completely off (e.g. "Motorcycle" and "Jet Ski"), and all images are clearly from completely different sources. The bonuses from these aren't particularly useful.

Despite this, I still played it for a bit. You'll finish the game in half hour or so (prestiging is pointless), yet I've played for a couple more hours to get up to prestige 9. There is the essence of something enjoyable here, but it's just far, far too simple.

When the gameplay runs out after 30 minutes of casual gameplay, but adverts are already implemented, it can leave a negative impression of where the developer's priorities lie. Still, I really hope this game goes on to improve, the developer's past game was in a much better state.

### Monetisation

Adverts can be watched for a small 10-roll bonus, but aren't worth it.

### Tips

- Upgrade maximum card level, it will make you absurdly rich.
- When grinding, just pick the card that displays the highest number.
- The game is updated often, it's probably better by now!
