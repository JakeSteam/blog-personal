This month I spent 2 weeks on the other side of the world, so was a bit busy for Android gaming! That being said, still found some time to play a couple of new ones...

The games are in descending order of "fun", and might contain mild spoilers:

## #1: Medieval Merge - [Download](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixodust.games.free.rpg.medieval.merge.puzzle.empire)

[Medieval Merge](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixodust.games.free.rpg.medieval.merge.puzzle.empire) is pretty similar to merge games I've played in the past, but has the RPG aesthetic theme making it stand out a bit.

### Review

The overworld's art style is much more appealing to me than the other merge games, and the quests actually make sense. For example if any enemy is blocking the path, you need to craft a sword to defeat them. Reward chests are also pretty generous, and energy recharges fast enough to have enough to play with every half hour or so if wanted.

Another positive feature is having 5+ quests active at all times, so you're never stuck waiting for a single item to recharge. 

The game's main drawback is perhaps the slightly repetitive nature of the quests, although this is alleviated by each of them making a noticeable difference in the overworld. Additionally, the board is pretty much constantly full, although this leads to tricky decision making and is probably part of the game's appeal.

### Monetisation

Whilst there's a few opportunities to watch ads (e.g. partially recharging empty item spawners), there's not as many as I expected. All of the in-app purchase options are bad deals, so despite playing for a few weeks I haven't spent any money.

It's a shame there isn't a non-currency microtransaction like speeding up energy recharge, especially as it's a singleplayer game!

### Tips

* As with all merge games, if there's a hard to obtain item, make sure you make as much progress towards it as possible whenever you have spare energy.
* Similarly, save up rare items (gems, xp) if possible.
* Some rare items come up repeatedly (e.g. high level swords), so it's worth building these up even before they're included in a quest.
* Merged spawners actually produce less, so if you've got space spare it's better to keep two same level spawners.
