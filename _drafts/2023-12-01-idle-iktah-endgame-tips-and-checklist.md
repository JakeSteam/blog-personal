I have been playing Idle Iktah almost obsessively for the last 6 weeks, and have finally reached 100% completion! In this post, I'll answer common questions from the [Discord](https://discord.gg/TRymHghrKA), reveal a few gameplay tips, as well as a small collection of mini-guides. Enjoy!

## FAQs

On the [Discord](https://discord.gg/TRymHghrKA), there are a *lot* of players who join and ask the same few questions. Hopefully by answering them here, players will be able to Google for answers instead!

### Items

#### Where do I get Gold recipes?

This is probably the most confusing part of the entire game! The recipes can be earned by:
* Collecting "Woodland Art" as rare drops in "The Hidden Grove" combat area. Clarifying potions (from alchemy) can then be used on these to randomly obtain the recipes, or junk items (shopping lists, cow poems, etc).
* As rare drops from all enemies in the medium/high levelled "Aurum Arrangement" combat area. Note that only the "Aurum Lord" drops the Gold Body instructions (as well as all others), so should be farmed if possible.

#### Where do I get Cod?

Confusingly, Cod *cannot* be fished. Instead it can be earned by:
* Purchased from the trader "Lerico", the fish salesman.
* As a common drop from killing the medium/high levelled "Aurum Peon" in the "Aurum Arrangement" combat area.

#### Where do I get Sasquatch Fur?

In "The Deep Forest" combat area, a Sasquatch will very rarely spawn. This Sasquatch drops Sasquatch Fur 100% of the time.

Note that this is an extremely rare spawn, and it took me ~6 hours of combat to obtain it.

I've heard a rumour that Rose-Tinted Goggles from "The Four Hatsmen" combat zone helps, but I haven't tried using them.

#### Where do I get Rare Shells?

Essentially by selling things without any other use.

For example, using pickaxe heads to make pickaxes provides great XP, and they are usually worth quite a lot. Similarly, if you've levelled a skill overnight you may end up with more lower level resources than you need. 

In general you won't need to spend too many rare shells early on, and you can likely use items for more direct purposes. This is especially true for rare items, use them for skills or save for later if you can. Monster drops can also be a good source of high value items.

Rare shells can also be obtained from shellfish.

#### Where do I get lots of Feathers?

By fighting in "The Deep Forest" and killing a *lot* of ducks! 

#### Where do I get Pearls?

Pearls are one of the rarest non-combat drop in the game, found in just 1/1000 shellfish opens. Shellfish can be caught by:
* Ocean fishing, if you have the "Otto" pet.
* Gathering at "Pechugh Bay" (unlocked by completing Library tier 1 in Community, speed depends on time of day).

Whilst opening shellfish, make sure you are using the ring that doubles gem drops. I *think* it works to double pearl drops. There are a few other rare places to obtain pearls (e.g. Pirate chest), but since you need 10 for a quest these aren't reliable enough.

I've heard rumours of a 1/100,000 chance "black pearl", but haven't seen it myself!

### Features

#### How do I unlock Expedition's Echo?

#### How do I beat the Bear game?

The Bear game is found in the bottom right "More" menu, with the bear icon. Your goal is to use your 3 hunters to trap the bear, it's a variant of the ancient [Bear games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_games).

Whilst this game's techniques can be learned with practice, the first few times can be confusing. Luckily, @micksnips2 on Discord wrote an excellent guide (with images) for both sighted and Voiceover users: [Bear game guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15AKhQzqKfO57g3Ij2Ono20eltIMDDJOurlBnXndtdyQ/edit).

#### What is Community? Mentoring? Buildings?

Whilst the in-game guide provides some information, community can be a little hard to get your head around. It's essentially 3 almost unrelated skills combined into 1:
1. **Buildings**: Use resources to construct buildings that give useful perks like increased mining speed. The first level of the Town Hall lets you also earn free daily building progress.
2. **Mentoring**: Train skills by helping NPCs. Your equipment and any boosts will be applied, you will keep the items, but you will earn Community XP instead. The percentage refers to how much of the normal XP your NPC will earn, this will change as they get more experienced.
3. **Community events**: Long running extremely high XP actions with absurdly high cooldowns.

#### Is there prestiging?

Yes! Once you have all 99s you can "Start a Legacy", whereby you specialize, pick perks, and begin the game again (whilst keeping your pet).

I haven't done this yet, as I'm enjoying my fully complete game!

### Other

#### What is the quest requirement with 10x man?

You need to kill Jeffrey in "The Four Hatsmen" combat area 10 times.

#### What is the quest requirement with 3x green monster?

You need to kill Forest Kin in "The Shimmering Cave" combat area 3 times.

#### How does the house work?

#### How do I get more inventory space?

The easiest way is to clear up your current space. Cook all raw fish, use up potion ingredients, sell junk.

If this still doesn't help, you need to craft generic bags from leather (dropped by monsters) via the Crafting skill.

Additionally, you can make use of specialised boxes (such as food only, rings only, etc) from the Carpentry skill.

## Tips

### General

Everything helps everything (diagram of mutual influences, e.g. fishing gives fish for cooking gives food for combat etc)

Scheduling 8-9hr jobs overnight

Aim to always be 2X xp

Take advantage of traders

99 enchanting indirectly gives you infinite currency

Always use the maximum time boost

Always use as many potions as possible

### Combat

Different places to grind (hidden grove best)

### Good XP in each skill
