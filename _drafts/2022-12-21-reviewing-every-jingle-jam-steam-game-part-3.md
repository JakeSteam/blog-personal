Every Christmas since 2011, one of my favourite content creators The Yogscast have organised the "Jingle Jam" [charity games bundle](https://jinglejam.tiltify.com/), which finishes *today*. Here's part 3, with games 61-83. 

## 5/5 Games

### Dude, Stop

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [81.71% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/574560/) | Â£11.99 | Puzzle | June 2018 | 158 (June 2018) |

Okay, yes, this is a pretty simple game that I perhaps only enjoy because of it's similarity to old meta Kongregate / Newgrounds games.

Dude, Stop is a collection of puzzles organised into packs, with "cups" unlocked for certain behaviours (e.g., failing all tasks). It's extremely self aware, in a similar vein to The Stanley Parable, and there's absolutely tons of content for every minute you'll be playing the game.

I suspect it isn't a super long game you can spend tens of hours with, but I'm still very eager to come back to this and complete it, and probably get 100% achievements.
