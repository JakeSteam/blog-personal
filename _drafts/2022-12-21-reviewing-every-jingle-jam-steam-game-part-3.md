Every Christmas since 2011, one of my favourite content creators The Yogscast have organised the "Jingle Jam" [charity games bundle](https://jinglejam.tiltify.com/), which finishes *today*. Here's part 3, with games 61-83. 

## 5/5 Games

### Dude, Stop

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [81.71% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/574560/) | £11.99 | Puzzle | June 2018 | 158 (June 2018) |

Okay, yes, this is a pretty simple game that I perhaps only enjoy because of it's similarity to old meta Kongregate / Newgrounds games.

Dude, Stop is a collection of puzzles organised into packs, with "cups" unlocked for certain behaviours (e.g., failing all tasks). It's extremely self aware, in a similar vein to The Stanley Parable, and there's absolutely tons of content for every minute you'll be playing the game.

I suspect it isn't a super long game you can spend tens of hours with, but I'm still very eager to come back to this and complete it, and probably get 100% achievements.

## 3/5 Games

### Factory Town

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [87.78% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/860890/) | £15.49 | Simulation | November 2021 | 2.6k (March 2021) |

Similar to quite a few other games on this list, this seems like an alright game, but it's not my genre at all.

Factory Town is a very detailed resource management system, with each resource needing gathering, processing, and selling. Personally I found every stage a bit too fiddly, and I never had much understanding of what my settlement was actually up to. Every interface was a little bit too clunky, every action took a few too many clicks.

I can absolutely see how someone could get into this, and spend tens of hours building up their civilisation. For me, it just wasn't rewarding enough to continue much past the tutorial.

### Deponia

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [85.55% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/214340/) | £6.99 | Point & Click | August 2012 | 1.2k (December 2013) |

Deponia is one of those games where the quality is obviously extremely high, and I can see how someone could fall in love with it but... I don't like point and click games.

I honestly didn't get very far at all, as I find the genre's gameplay style too frustrating and trial and error based. Based on other reviews, Deponia is apparently a good example of the genre, albeit a little frustrating at times. I can only vouch for the 2nd half of that description!

### Final Vendetta

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [76.16% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1891090/) | £22.49 | Fighting | June 2022 | 23 (June 2022) |

Final Vendetta is a tricky game to judge, since it's obviously very intentionally emulating retro beat 'em ups (even down to a CRT filter), but doesn't innovate on this format. As such, it's hard to know why someone would choose this game over the many similar ones released in the last few decades.

Combat felt a little unfair, with quite simple controls / moves and some enemies having unblockable attacks. The gameplay isn't bad, it's just nothing new. That being said, the pixel art is pretty attractive!

### Eternal Hope

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [81.26% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1162280/) | £9.29 | Puzzle | August 2020 | 24 (August 2020) |

Ever played Limbo? Alright, if you have then you already understand most of this game.

Eternal Hope has all the same physics based puzzles from Limbo, plus an additional mechanic letting you "change dimensions". In practice this usually does nothing, but at specific places reveals a helping hand or enemy.

Overall this isn't a bad game at all, it's just hard to appreciate it when it wears its inspiration so clearly.
