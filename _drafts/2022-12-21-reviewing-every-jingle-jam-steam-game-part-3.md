Every Christmas since 2011, one of my favourite content creators The Yogscast have organised the "Jingle Jam" [charity games bundle](https://jinglejam.tiltify.com/), which finishes *today*. Here's part 3, with games 61-83. 

## 5/5 Games

### Dude, Stop

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [81.71% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/574560/) | £11.99 | Puzzle | June 2018 | 158 (June 2018) |

Okay, yes, this is a pretty simple game that I perhaps only enjoy because of its similarity to old meta Kongregate / Newgrounds games.

Dude, Stop is a collection of puzzles organised into packs, with "cups" unlocked for certain behaviours (e.g., failing all tasks). It's extremely self-aware, in a similar vein to The Stanley Parable, and there's absolutely tons of content for every minute you'll be playing the game.

I suspect it isn't a super long game you can spend tens of hours with, but I'm still very eager to come back to this and complete it, and probably get 100% achievements.

### Here Comes Niko

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [86.35% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/925950/) | £19.49 | Adventure | August 2021 | 415 (August 2021) |

Very cute, very comfy, very chill!

Here Comes Niko is pretty much solving mini puzzles and exploring various islands, with your main objectives being to help others and make new friends. Whilst this game isn't challenging or competitive, it is a nice way to spend a few hours. The writing / light storytelling is addictive, with little bits of humour here and there providing motivation to talk to new characters.

I played through the first couple of islands, I'm interested to see how much more content there is, and whether it can be 100%'d. The only downside is the controller buttons are a bit odd, with "B" acting as "A" and "Start" acting as "Back". Still, this only applies to the menu, within the game itself it's all very intuitive.

### Discolored

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [76.11% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/933860/) | £5.49 | Puzzle | November 2019 | 34 (December 2022) |

Whilst Discolored is technically a point and click game, it's done in such an intuitive and mysterious way that I deeply enjoyed it. 

It was a relatively short experience (1-2 hours depending on puzzle solving), but at no point did I feel completely lost. Instead, I could solve each stage logically after a few minutes of considering the unknown objects / areas I hadn't found a use for yet. There's also a pretty helpful "hint" feature that I used a couple of times, that gives enough of a clue to avoid feeling completely lost, but doesn't just solve a puzzle for you.

This is an excellent example of the kind of point and click game I like, where each step feels logically solvable without random clicking, and every item has a specific purpose. [The sequel comes out next year](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1859720/Discolored_2/), I can't wait!

## 4/5 Games

### Fury Unleashed

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [85.68% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/465200/) | £17.99 | Platformer | May 2020 | 521 (July 2021) |

Fury Unleashed is a roguelite platformer shooter, with a meta story backing it up. 

The movement and gameplay is solid, and reminds me a lot of the frantic yet precise feel to games like Spelunky. I only played through the first 2 chapters (twice, it is a roguelite after all!) and the story had some intriguing meta elements to it, with a comic book style without. This manifests itself in "ink" as currency, the occasional "sketched" levels, and a narrator describing each chapter.

The levels can get a bit bullet-hell at times, with enemy movement and various projectiles all over the place. Because of this, I found it tricky to get through a level perfectly, something that is usually possible in games like Spelunky. Due to this, there's more of a reliance on accepting damage, but then healing from it moving forward.

Definitely looking forward to a few more runs through this!

### Gene Shift Auto

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [78.25% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/308600/) | £12.79 (base game free) | Action | May 2017 | 214k (December 2018) |

I'll admit, I judged this game by its title, and was expecting a cheap GTA rip-off. Luckily I was very wrong!

This is a battle royale style interpretation of classic GTA titles. It's a chaotic mess of bullets, explosions, and NPCs, and very, very fun. The game itself is actually free (which explains why it once had 214k(!) players), but the premium upgrade was included in the Jingle Jam pack. As far as I can tell this doesn't give many benefits besides extra coins / XP drops, used to unlock new skills.

The skills are nice and silly, with things like increased bullet speed, vampirism, spawning homing rockets etc. All of these help make every fight unpredictable, whether it's against police or other players.

I won my first game, but given the skill level of some players I strongly suspect it was a "new players only" matchmaking game! Whilst Gene Shift Auto maybe isn't for me, it's a very good free game for someone seeking an old GTA-style online experience.

### Sokpop: Hellblusser

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [81.04% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1695480/) | £4.99 | RPG | August 2021 | 16 (August 2021) |

This is a bare bones but interesting RPG, with the typical Sokpop-style distortion of the camera. 

As with many RPGs, you're mostly wandering through corridors killing everything with your sword or magic, then upgrading equipment / perks when possible. The unique gimmick is the ability to "absorb" fire from ambient sources and use it as a fireball, leading to desperate environment hunting when a melee-immune enemy is chasing you!

I found the boss at the end of the sewer levels a bit too challenging, as I couldn't figure out a way to inflict a single point of damage on it. Considering this is after 7-8 levels of combat, and death means starting from the beginning, it's quite a punishing learning curve.

Overall this is worth a few runthroughs, although the levels can be a bit repetitive. Looking at the Steam page, these levels are procedurally generated, with 3 "areas" (themes) to beat.

### Kaiju Wars

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [79.90% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1508400/) | £15.49 | Strategy | April 2022 | 91 (May 2022) |

This is another game that I watched on Twitch during the Jingle Jam [by Lewis & Ben](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7xKszO_aVc). The aesthetic appealed, and who doesn't like giant kaijus?

The strategy (at least in the first few levels) was pretty simple, mostly around pumping out units to try and slow the kaiju down whilst also saving up for new bases and other larger investments. There's lots of acted cutscenes and backstory that adds some atmosphere to the combat, with custom missions and power-ups to add some complexity.

I liked the semi-nihilistic tone of the game, with each battle obviously just being trying to survive for a bit longer, not actually wiping out any opponents permanently. The overall style reminded me a lot of older XCOM games, with a bit of the "rock paper scissors" style combat of Advance Wars. Definitely an easy game to spend a few hours in if the aesthetic appeals.

### Killrun

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [64.21% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1442170/) | £3.99 | FPS | August 2022 | 88 (August 2022) |

Take CounterStrike, merge it with Superhot (minus the time manipulation elements), and you'd end up with Killrun!

Each short level is a combination puzzle / test of FPS ability, with the entire goal being getting the quickest checkpoint touching & enemy killing completion possible. These enemies don't shoot back, so they're essentially 3D target practice. A good run feels absolutely amazing, and looks like an edited highlights reel from a montage. With crouching, powerups, quickscoping, and all the FPS staples, it definitely felt a lot like I was playing a serious shooter. Spoiling that illusion (for the better!) are various powerups that give temporary abilities like dashing forward and enemy highlighting (looks just like Superhot!).

It's very hard to represent this game in still images, since it's all about the speed of the run, and how each kill flows into the next. [The trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HreilFYfumw) does a much better job than words and images ever could. There are 60 levels currently available, with more packs on the way.

Finally, there's also "mods" for your weapons, which are just cosmetic skins. Whilst looking at this, I discovered the developer is the same one behind The Turing Test, also in this bundle, [which I rated 5/5](/reviewing-every-jingle-jam-steam-game/#the-turing-test)!

## 3/5 Games

### House

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [91.98% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1444350/) | £7.19 | Puzzle | October 2020 | 202 (July 2021) |

Full confession, I saw half a playthrough of this game on a [Yogscast Jingle Jam stream with Sips & Lydia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzGYPnZMZ7o), so already had a few preconceptions going in.

House is essentially a puzzle game where you have a limited period of time to find various endings to the story. This can be done by finding objects, using them on the environment, interacting with characters, etc. My first playthrough I impressively walked into my own beartrap, which was such a lame ending it didn't even unlock an achievement! 

This is undoubtedly a very creative game, and I can see how hunting all of the unique endings could be addictive. It's not really for me, but the gory mystery solving may be for you.

### JARS

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [73.36% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1590750/) | £9.99 | Puzzle | October 2021 | 18 (December 2022) |

JARS claims to be a strategy / tower defense game, but there's really not enough time per level to call it that. Instead, each level is a few seconds of frantic clicking / hotkeying to open jars and handle their contents, then it's over either positively or negatively!

Whilst there are some elements of puzzle solving, this is more a challenge of prioritisation, not any actual challenging aspect. As such, winning a level doesn't feel too rewarding. However, there does seem to be quite a lot of content. From minions to enemies to comic books and cutscenes, new significant content is unlocked every level or two. If you're into the gameplay style, there's plenty here to play with!

### Factory Town

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [87.78% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/860890/) | £15.49 | Simulation | November 2021 | 2.6k (March 2021) |

Similar to quite a few other games on this list, this seems like an alright game, but it's not my genre at all.

Factory Town is a very detailed resource management system, with each resource needing gathering, processing, and selling. Personally I found every stage a bit too fiddly, and I never had much understanding of what my settlement was actually up to. Every interface was a little bit too clunky, every action took a few too many clicks.

I can absolutely see how someone could get into this, and spend tens of hours building up their civilisation. For me, it just wasn't rewarding enough to continue much past the tutorial.

### Deponia

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [85.55% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/214340/) | £6.99 | Point & Click | August 2012 | 1.2k (December 2013) |

Deponia is one of those games where the quality is obviously extremely high, and I can see how someone could fall in love with it but... I don't like point and click games.

I honestly didn't get very far at all, as I find the genre's gameplay style too frustrating and trial and error based. Based on other reviews, Deponia is apparently a good example of the genre, albeit a little frustrating at times. I can only vouch for the 2nd half of that description!

### Final Vendetta

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [76.16% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1891090/) | £22.49 | Fighting | June 2022 | 23 (June 2022) |

Final Vendetta is a tricky game to judge, since it's obviously very intentionally emulating retro beat 'em ups (even down to a CRT filter), but doesn't innovate on this format. As such, it's hard to know why someone would choose this game over the many similar ones released in the last few decades.

Combat felt a little unfair, with quite simple controls / moves and some enemies having unblockable attacks. The gameplay isn't bad, it's just nothing new. That being said, the pixel art is pretty attractive!

### Eternal Hope

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [81.26% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1162280/) | £9.29 | Puzzle | August 2020 | 24 (August 2020) |

Ever played Limbo? Alright, if you have then you already understand most of this game.

Eternal Hope has all the same physics based puzzles from Limbo, plus an additional mechanic letting you "change dimensions". In practice this usually does nothing, but at specific places reveals a helping hand or enemy.

Overall this isn't a bad game at all, it's just hard to appreciate it when it wears its inspiration so clearly.

## 2/5

### Kitaria Fables

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [74.28% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1356280/) | £16.99 | RPG | September 2021 | 1.0k (September 2021) |

Kitaria Fables was a very slow experience. VERY dialog heavy, VERY fetch quest heavy, and I quickly found myself just mashing the A button to try and get through the endless dialog ASAP. This meant I accidentally selected a few dialog options, but it was worth it to avoid the boredom!

The combat itself is actually pretty fun, with a simple attack (or use skills) and dodge system. Unfortunately, the story was too over the top and needlessly wordy to make it worth the effort. As an example, the very start of the game is walking between 3 locations multiple times just to talk to the same NPCs. All immediately after a length cutscene, a ridiculously lengthy initial 4-way conversation.

Looking at other reviews, they all mention that the game gets even more grindy later on, so one to avoid as far as I can tell. On the plus side, my cat liked the repetitive nature of the movement during combat / walking!

| [66.44% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/671510/) | £19.99 | Puzzle | January 2019 | 1.8k (February 2018) |

This is perhaps one of those games that is better with friends. By myself, it was just a janky experience wandering around a wilderness, where everything I meet kills me pretty quickly. Fun. The late game might be fun, but the beginning is just an unpleasant experience, doing pointless tasks just for a generic mob to kill you.

### First Class Trouble

| Steam rating | Price | Genre | Released | Peak players
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [76.53% - Store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/953880/) | £10.99 | Multiplayer | November 2021 | 1.2k (April 2021) |

Here's the story of me trying to play this:

1. I open the game, and immediately have to scroll to the bottom of & approve *three* different agreements.
2. I go to play the tutorial, it's just a few pages of text.
3. I click play, get put into a lobby as the traitor / humanoid, experience horrific frame rate drops.
4. 2 players walk up to me, grab me & strangle me. I die.
5. I mess around as a flying hoover for 10 minutes.

At no point was there any fun. Perhaps this is a good game if you have friends to play in a lobby, but online matchmaking doesn't seem great. I know [The Yogscast](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpRe-VsLz6CTFBcBo8eHWgJP67FuoxOX2) used to play it, and personally I skipped the videos as it just felt like GMod TTT but not as good.
