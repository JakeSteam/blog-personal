intro

## #1: [Spin Hero](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=spherestudios.spinheromobile)

Similar in concept to games like Spincraft ([reviewed 2 years ago](https://jakelee.co.uk/april-may-android-game-reviews/#1-spincraft-roguelike)), Spin Hero is all about fighting your way through dungeons using the synergy between items in your slot machine. It's great!

### Screenshots

All screenshots are from version 1.2.1:

### Review

As mentioned, Spin Hero is all about combat. After picking from the 4 heros (essentially Melee, Thief, Lifesteal, Boss Hunter), and choosing your starter item pack (e.g. a more melee focussed one, or a blind one with more coins, etc), you'll begin your adventure.

Making your way through enemies, elite enemies, bosses, chests, and shops, your goal is to build up a "deck" of items that can deal enough damage whilst still defending yourself from enemy attacks. You'll be attacking with melee (some weapons degrade), ranged (need a bow and arrows), or magic (need mana), or (ideally!) some combination of all 3.

Each turn you'll spin, your items will interact with each other and calculate the melee / range / mage attack, your armour, and "apply" it to the enemy. Deal more damage than their armour & health? You win, time for the next round, until you complete the entire stage!

Layered on top of this basic gameplay loop are 12 status effects, from simple things like Poison or Regeneration to interesting modifiers like Shock (randomly increase / decrease all attacks) or Frail (reduces armour gain). These effects operate in "stacks", so 20 stacked Poison will deal 20x as much damage, making it entirely possible to focus on accumulating these effects during a run.

There are also "Runes", essential manual attacks with a cooldown. They typically apply a stack of some kind, and can be purchased in the store alongside various items. Oh right, the items...

The main way your runs will vary are the items. Stacking effects, combining the effects of similar items, and eventually getting a crazy overpowered item are what drive your runs. I've done a few melee & lifesteal driven runs, where the entire aim is to maximise damage (and therefore healing), using melee weapons that affect each other. For example, axes often amplify the damage of nearby axes, or even permanently increase their damage.

Items are selected after each enemy kill (with stronger enemies rewarding better items) or in the store, with limited rerolls. They have the typical rarity colours, although I've only seen 1 Legendary item and 0 Uniques yet.

Range and mage a bit trickier to use than melee, since even the best bow (ignoring infinity bows!) still needs a quiver either near them or on the board and mana for magic is a constantly draining and renewing resource. To balance this they typically deal more damage, so if you get a good collection of items (e.g. items that gain mana more than you use it) the combat styles can be impressively high damage.

These items can get confusing, especially when they have multiple damage multipliers applied, making the ability to tap an item for details being super helpful.

Finally, your characters will also gain XP and unlock new unique abilities as you play. After completing all 5 stages as a character (I managed with Baldwin's Lifesteal!), you unlock modifiers making the game a bit more difficult (e.g. extra enemy HP), unfortunately after managing to complete the game once, there's not much extra gameplay to encourage repeated playthroughs.

### Monetisation

Spin Hero is a one-off payment of £3.99 (~$5), or is included in Google Play Pass.

### Tips

- You can drastically increase the turn speed with the `>>>>` in the bottom right, and enable autospin (not recommended).
- Read items carefully, and mentally keep track of what resources (e.g. mana) you have a surplus or deficit of.
- Anything that _permanently_ stacks (e.g. max mana, damage per hit) will become essential later on, as enemy health scales up.
- It's usually worth fighting basic enemies since you _should_ be able to kill them easily, gaining gold and stacking permanent item boosts.
- I love lifesteal in games, and it seems super powerful in Spin Hero too!
- The game is [also available on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2917350/Spin_Hero/) for the same price, where it has received "Mostly Positive" reviews.
- There's a [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/2nfp3RPwr9) for the game, with the developer being fairly active.
