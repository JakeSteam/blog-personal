I recently received a LEGO Porsche 911 RSR as a gift, and during the build process a few odd things happened. Pieces didn't look quite right, the packaging wasn't what I was used to... it's a fake! However, it's such a high quality fake that I didn't realise until 1/3 of the way through, and I decided to keep it. Here's how to avoid being scammed.

## Backstory

## Fake indicators

### Bags aren't standard

### Slight misalignment

Engine block, red 2 cross piece was slightly misaligned.

### Pieces aren't assembled

* Hydraulic spring
* Steering wheel joint

### Manual print quality is lower

### Box had non-standard tape seals

Just regular sellotape

## Thoughts on fake sets

* Quality is amazing, but don't want to buy them. R&D, design, quality control etc goes into the real thing.

## Conclusion

- also include Cassie sitting on box... maybe as banner
