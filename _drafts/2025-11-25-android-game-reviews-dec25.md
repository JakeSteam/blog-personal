3 more Android games I've been playing lately, with 2 from the same developer!

## #1: [Ironpost](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.genetix.ironpost)

I've played a few of [GX Studio's games](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=695774513565373570) before over the last few years, and like [Kairosoft's games](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=7710637777904825280), you _kinda_ know what you're in for, just with a different skin each time. This time, it's tower defence.

### Screenshots

All screenshots are from version 1.1.3:

### Review

As with [GX Studio's other games](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=695774513565373570) (e.g. Lone Tower, reviewed [2 years ago](/june-july-android-game-reviews/#3-lone-tower)), you complete a 1-10 minute playthrough of a simple game (in this case tower defence), with upgrades along the way, until you either fail or complete all stages. Either way you'll earn gems for permanent upgrades, with success having the benefit of unlocking harder, more rewarding difficulties.

The upgrades are varied but fairly straightforward, with simple stats like attack range, speed, and damage placed alongside knockback, lifesteal, luck (for critical hits), gold rewards on kill, etc. Killing enemies earns you coins to upgrade these within the run, earning gems lets you permanent unlock these. Additionally, there are occasional opportunities to pick perks such as extra damage, more XP per kill, etc.

This fairly simply gameplay loop is somewhat improved by the concept of "cards" (basically permanent upgradeable powerups). These can be as basic as crates giving more gold & XP, or situational such as extra damage when low HP.

The actual tower defence part of the game pretty much plays itself, with your interaction mostly limited to tapping the occasional crates that appear, and hoping you survive to the next upgrade opportunity. Oddly, the game also includes a fairly standard blackjack gambling system from the main menu.

Since initially downloading the game in August, a few new features (Auto crate open, auto perk pick) have been added alongside the existing quality of life features such as button colour customisation, increasing game speed, etc.

Overall, Ironpost isn't very complex, but it is a fairly satisfying way to spend 10-30 minutes occasionally, especially without any adverts or aggressive monetisation. Speaking from experience, it works great as a vertical split-screen game before bed if you're watching something else!

Looking at my statistics, I've played 80 runs, killed 23,000 enemies, and have unlocked Tier 6 difficulty.

_Note: I emailed the dev a bug report back in August and he fixed it a few days later, but other than that I have no connection / affiliation with the game._

### Monetisation

Adverts are available for a fairly minor boost, but are not forced, overpowered, or at all required.

### Tips

- There is a fairly active [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/gaDqxkTTGp) for all GX Studio games.
- I found Attack Speed to be the most powerful upgrade, with Attack Damage and Kill Gold Bonus being my next priorities.
- When picking perks mid-run, always choose more souls per kill if possible.
- I didn't find Interest Rate / Max Interest useful at all, since I typically spend all my gold.
- You _can_ manually aim your archer by tapping, but it doesn't seem to be very useful.
- For cards, you should aim to unlock all slots as soon as possible, and only upgrade the cards you find useful. For me, this was:
  - Critical Gold: Earn gold on critical hit.
  - Critical XP: Earn XP on critical hit.
  - Critical Heart: Heal on critical hit.
  - Plunder: Enemies sometimes drop gems on death.
  - Supply Drop: More gold & gems in crates.

## #2: [Word Run](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.genetix.wordrun)

It's another GX Studio game, like the first game in this article! This time, the gameplay loop is spelling words instead of tower defence.

### Screenshots

All screenshots are from version 1.0.4:

### Review

Get a 4x4 grid of letters, spell the best word you can (or shuffle to get new letters), earn enough points to complete the round before you run out of Plays. That's it!

As with all GX Studio games, you'll pick from perks throughout your run, and be able to buy permanent upgrades with gems earned from each run. Unfortunately the 4x4 grid makes it quite hard to actually spell decent words, especially as all letters seem to have equal likelihood, so you'll end up with no vowels, or 3 X's. Most of my words are 4-5 letters.

A preview screenshot on the Play Store shows a 5x5 letter grid, which would be _much_ easier (25 letters vs 16), so it's a real shame that doesn't seem to have made it to the final design.

Throughout your run, you'll have a small chance to spawn gold, heart, star, and tree tiles:

- Gold tiles: Earn gold when shuffling tiles.
- Heart: Earn 1 Play when used.
- Star: Earn +1 to multiplier (increase score of next word) when used.
- Tree: Tile gains 1 value every time a word is played.

These are unfortunately quite simple tools with little strategy involved. Obviously with Plays being the most important part of the game, playing heart tiles is a no-brainer, with the others being rare enough that they should almost always be played.

The constantly slightly moving background is somewhat distracting whilst trying to spell words, and I found it harder than usual to spell words that score well. The round-based nature of the game also means that using a good tile (e.g. a useful "s" or high-value consonant) removes it from the board, however the difficulty of spelling strong words means this doesn't end up being a concern.

Higher difficulties feel hard, but the difficulty does not feel _fair_. If you are given a board with a single vowel, you simply cannot spell a good word. Whilst you can shuffle for new letters, there's no guarantee there'll be any vowels, or useful consonants.

Overall this feels too simplistic for now, with little incentive to keep grinding. Each difficulty plays and looks identical, except with higher targets and more gem rewards. Despite usually being a fan of word games, and "upgrade after each run" games, Word Run just doesn't do it for me.

Looking at my statistics, I've played 20 games and my best score is 421.

### Monetisation

Unfortunately, there are forced video ads after every run, and no incentivised adverts / in-app purchases.

This is probably my least liked kind of monetisation, since it's not even possible to pay to remove the adverts. However, they are at least predictable. Additionally, with a run taking up to 10 minutes, they are infrequent.

### Tips

It's just spelling words, there ares not many tips! I found Plays to be the most important element, so anything that increases those is worth buying. Then, anything that improves point earning.

## #3: [Puzzle Peaks EXE](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appsir.puzzlingpeaksgame)

A nice and simple physics-based platformer, with quick gameplay loops and plenty of levels.

### Screenshots

All screenshots are from version 3.5:

### Review

Puzzle Peaks EXE has a story. I'm not following it in the slightest, something about a virtual assistant and following their advice (or not), and "glitches"? Luckily, it isn't important!

In Puzzle Peaks, you'll be solving straightforward physics puzzles with just 2 controls: rotate orange platforms left, and rotate them right. This simple control scheme makes gameplay very easy and reliable to control (tap left or right half of screen), whilst the clever level design ensures you're constantly being taught new techniques and movement strategies. Later platforms rotate the _other_ way, but in general you'll almost always be rotating orange platforms.

Whilst some levels can be essentially brute forced, most require learning some sort of tactic, and combining both timing and precise movement to fling your skull towards the indicated exit. Most take an average player (me!) around 2-10 tries, although occasionally you'll get stuck on an awkward throw.

The level design does an excellent job of balancing difficulty, with each level feeling instantly _solvable_, whilst still being challenging. So far, I've completed 63 out of the available 100, and I'm expecting to eventually work finish the whole thing.

Unfortunately the game isn't perfect, with the virtual assistant's dialog not being subtitled, and no sound controls(!) in the game. This makes it a poor game for multitasking, yet as a simple physics puzzler you're unlikely to want sound on at all times.

### Monetisation

A one-off $1.99 payment, also included in Google Play Pass.

### Tips

- The game is [also available on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1475420/Puzzling_Peaks_EXE/), although the touch controls make it well suited for mobile.
- Blindly flinging your skull is rarely the correct solution, it can usually be logically solved.
- Sometimes you need to nudge your skull onto the _other_ half of a rotating platform before rotating the correct way to build up enough momentum for a fling.
