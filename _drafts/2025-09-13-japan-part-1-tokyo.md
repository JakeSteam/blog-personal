_Note: This is a series of posts, with Tokyo Part 1 (this article), Takayama [Part 2](/japan-part-2-takayama/), Kyoto [Part 3](/japan-part-3-kyoto/), and Tokyo [Part 4](/japan-part-4-tokyo/)._

## Day 1 (22nd August): Arrival & Asakusa

We arrived in Tokyo at an impressively early 7am after a 14-hour flight, so our jetlag and exhaustion levels were immense!

Despite this, our wandering around Asakusa both before our hotel's check-in time, and then after a much-needed nap, resulted in **13,441 steps (5.84 miles)**.

### Onyado Nono Asakusa ★★★★★

We had an excellent experience at Onyado Nono! The breakfast is the highlight feature, with an impressive variety of Japanese and Western options available, all freshly made.

Rooms are small but clean, with tatami mats throughout. Shoes are always stored in a locker area by the entrance, with comfortable loungewear & slippers provided in rooms. At breakfast, typically 50-90% of people will be wearing the beige loungewear, I recommend it!

Staff are helpful and very friendly, with standard laundry facilities available on the 2nd floor (plus tracking of them via the TV!). This made it a convenient place to do laundry on our trip.

### Age.3 ★★★★★

Age.3 is a strange innovation on sandwiches, with their sweet ones ending up something like cream-filled waffles. Worth a visit if nearby, although I'd recommend sharing 1 since they're pretty sweet!

### Sensō-ji Hozomon Gate ★★★★✰

Whilst the gate is overly full of tourists during the day, at night it becomes an excellent place to walk through. Unfortunately there is only a small amount of information available (entirely about the 2 statues), with the gate serving primarily as a photo opportunity and little else.

### Sensō-ji Five-Storied Pagoda ★★★★✰

As with most temples in the Senso-ji area, it is far better to visit at night for the visuals. Tourists are not allowed inside, and there is nothing to do here besides looking from the outside.

**[Original review (3 photos)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/e2xJrjixkJmc1E188)**

### Sensō-ji Temple ★★★★✰

The main part of the Senso-ji complex, good luck making it past all the tourists during the day! Worth visiting, you'll occasionally see locals making a contribution during open hours.

**[Original review (2 photos)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gv8RjPwqdPhtFjzy6)**

### Kaminari mon ★★★✰✰

Technically part of the Senso-ji temple, the close proximity to Nakamise shopping street makes this perhaps the most touristy part of the entire complex. You'll see tourists taking tripod photos / selfies at pretty much any hour, and during the day there is a dense crowd here. I'd highly recommend moving 100m up the road to Sensi-ji's Hozomon Gate for a bigger and better gate, with fewer people!

**[Original review](https://maps.app.goo.gl/98qAyTYNT6zmkmHH7)**

### Nakamise shopping street ★★★✰✰

This street features a variety of fairly touristy foods, drinks, and souvenirs. This street is completely full of people during the day, with lots of options for (overpriced) snacks from small shops where around half only accept cash. If you need to go through here I highly recommend using the 2 side streets.

At night the street gains a very peaceful vibe, with artwork on lots of the shop's shutters.

### Okimaro ★★★★★

This small cafe-style restaurant serving Okinawan was a pleasant surprise after struggling to find somewhere to eat a casual lunch near the Tokyo Skytree.

Around 10 people can be seated, and I'd highly recommend getting in before 12. We arrived at 11:50, and by 12:10 every seat was full of salarymen clearly having their regular lunches!

The portions are large, and whilst there is an excellent value lunch set menu available we went for a grilled chicken bowl and a limited-quantity pork belly based meal, along with a banana milk drink. An english menu is available out front, as well as inside.

### Gong Cha Asakusa ROX ★★★✰✰

A standard bubble / fruit tea shop, inside the ROX mall. It had quite a loud and chaotic vibe, clearly being a brief stop for families during shopping trips.

**[Original review](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SYu6jmK8PMNwjxzG6)**

### Hoppy Street ★★★✰✰

Pretty much just a tourist trap, walking down here at night will see you shouted at by various touts, with far more affordable / genuine izakayas available elsewhere. If you're here at night, I'd recommend walking through senso-ji instead.

**[Original review](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KkiUpeqELp7taJUN7)**

### Sumida Park ★★★★✰

A good spot for a brief rest if travelling from Asakusa towards the Skytree. Some shade, limited seating, and standard toilet facilities. The strip of shops alongside can be useful.

**[Original review](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AtcQbaQyfNgGVcxz6)**

### Asakusa Gyukatsu ★★★★★

One of the best meals we had during a few weeks in Japan! There is almost always a queue outside, however late at night you can get in fairly quickly, with your order taken whilst queueing. The only options are 1, 1.5, or 2 beef cutlets, so picking should be easy!

Once inside, you are quickly served a tray of tonkatsu, and your cooking slab is heated. The beef cutlets are somehow ridiculously tasty and melt apart in your mouth, with the final few minutes of cooking yourself mostly just tweaking the flavour.

Helpfully, a guide on how to use each item / dip is provided in front of you in English and Japanese, since it can get a little confusing (there's a small mochi dessert included). We ordered 1 cutlet each, I'd probably recommend 1.5.

## Day 2 (23rd August): Ginza

Our first full day in Tokyo focused on the Tsukiji / Ginza area, making our way from the riverfront to Tokyo Station (with lots of shops along the way) resulted in **23,018 steps (10.70 miles)**.

[![Japan 1 day 2 map](/assets/images/2025/japan1-day2-thumbnail.png)](/assets/images/2025/japan1-day2.png)

### Tsukiji Outer Market ★★★★✰

This chaotic market is unique, and has plenty to offer even if you have no interest in seafood. It's hard to know exactly which shops you're buying from, so you'll have to rely on instinct instead or reviews!

Whilst here we had matcha shaved ice, a custard dessert slab, and glazed fruit, all of which were great. The inner market is mostly fish, with the outer market consisting of more standard snacks and drinks. It's a BIG area, and finding a past shop can be tricky so just buy anything you like the look of!

It can get very crowded here, with some of the smaller alleyways being impossible to get down if a larger family or eating tour group is currently in there. The main roads and outside are easily navigated though, note many will only accept cash however.

**[Original review (3 photos)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/u4AuxYLyQxTm8FeJ9)**

### TEATRO eFfe TOKYO ★★★✰✰

A very sweet cream soda and matcha latte, plus fairly high prices and an enforced 1-drink-per-person policy (even when completely empty) makes the store hard to recommend if you're just after a drink. However, it does have good air con and is in a convenient location.

**[Original review](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fHRKG4k8DaPYFnJ86)**

### Hamarikyu Gardens ★★★★★

A good way to spend a few hours, with the small entry fee ensuring it's a quiet and peaceful contrast to the nearby Tsukiji market.

The Shonoji Isle bridges are great for photos, with the duck hunting sites providing some interesting information on how ducks were historically trapped here (it includes trained decoys!). The 300-year old pine is also impressively gnarled, whilst the Shogun's Landing Place is a fairly bland concrete area.

A special shoutout for the "rest area" is needed, since the shaded zone with sprayed water vapour (and a nearby drink seller) was absolutely essential when visiting on a summer day.

Overall it's a very aesthetic and well maintained garden area, providing contrast from the busy city nearby.

**[Original review (3 photos)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5MBQMSwWj17xzigo6)**

### Marutake ★★★★✰

This popular cash-only shop primarily sells warm tamago (sweet egg omelette), with a small strip costing 200 yen. Whilst nice, it's not particularly unique (there's another shop on the same street). There's no eating area, so you'll need to stand in the busy & chaotic street.

**[Original review (1 photo)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/T5Vf8JdR9pZTaD868)**

### Tomago-to-watashi ★★✰✰✰

Small restaurant within the station selling omurice (fluffy egg pancake with rice). The "soufflé" version was better, but both were fairly basic yet expensive meals. We struggled to get noticed when trying to make an order, with staff members seemingly initially avoiding us due to being foreigners, however there was an English menu available.

**[Original review](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SvLRAin8CGherT387)**

### Ginza Itoya ★★★★✰

A multi-level stationary store, even if you're not particularly into arts & crafts it's intriguing seeing all the options available. The ground floor is a bit too busy, and it can be hard to navigate.

**[Original review](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9Evmzcw2HrUFztoL8)**

### Ippudo Asakusa ★★★★★

Great ramen, fast service, order is via a touchscreen making it easy for foreigners. Ippudo was one of the few places open late at night, a lucky find!

Careful of the spicy ramen, they really mean spicy.

## Day 3 (24th August): Mt Fuji & Hakone

The entire day was taken up with a trip to Mt Fuji and Hakone, with lots of travel time resulting in only **7,339 steps (2.62 miles)**.

[![Japan 1 day 3 map](/assets/images/2025/japan1-day3-thumbnail.png)](/assets/images/2025/japan1-day3.png)

### Mt Fuji / Hakone TripAdvisor tour ★★★★★

This day trip exceeded our expectations! Whilst there was a fair amount of travelling on the bus, this time was used very productively by Aya (with Yamasan driving) to educate about Japan, Mt Fuji, a few Japanese words, and much more.

A brief warning about the meeting point at Shinjuku, there are multiple groups meeting here at once (including multiple from Japan Panoramic Tours), so get there a little early and listen carefully to the groups. We had a few people looking for a Tokyo bus tour getting a bit confused!

Our first main stop, Mt Fuji 5th station, was unexpectedly very busy with hikers, making it tricky to do much there in the allotted time besides buying a few souvenirs and seeing a viewpoint. It was unfortunately cloudy when we visited, so it was a little surreal being surrounded by grey nothingness!

Lunch was a weak point, with a very average "buffet" provided at a strange ninja experience / scenic garden / restaurant hybrid called Shinobi No Sato. At least there was a good shop and the garden was pleasant to walk around.

The ropeway was busier than normal so we had to change plans slightly here, with Aya and another guide impressively changing the itinerary on the fly (including rebooking boats etc) to ensure we still got to do everything. The changed plan was arguably better, with a flyover of the sulfur mines now included, a very alien sight.

Finally, the cruise after the ropeway was excellent! The scenery was breathtaking, and on a hot day the breeze was a welcome break. The boat did a 180 after departing the dock, so our average position at the back became an excellent view forward!

Throughout the day, Aya was informative, friendly, funny and energetic. She had far more patience than I would have with people wandering off, with an early incident disciplined with lighthearted and effective brief teasing instead of anything more dramatic. Aya also made an effort to get not just a group photo at the end, but also take photos for couples at multiple opportunities.

It was truly impressive how she managed to coordinate everyone, and provide information throughout, whilst still finding the time to talk to every group (usually couples) individually about their travel plans, Japan experience, etc. She provided us with some excellent restaurant and vintage shopping recommendations (and local slang!) in her native Osaka, many of which we utilised later in our trip.

I highly recommend the tour, and can't thank Aya enough!

## Day 4 (25th August): Ueno & Akihabara

A fairly meandering (and very hot!) day around Ueno then Akihabara, resulting in **16,778 steps (6.73 miles)**.

[![Japan 1 day 4 map](/assets/images/2025/japan1-day4-thumbnail.png)](/assets/images/2025/japan1-day4.png)

### Shinobazu Pond Bentendo ★★★★★

A surprisingly pleasant small temple surrounded by a lotus flower pond (with turtles!), very quiet in the mornings. The inside is fairly typical for a temple, peaceful and visually appealing. You can also buy small blessings and similar items.

**[Original review (2 photos)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GsW5VB6PnxXeUuYu7)**

### Kanazawa Maimonzushi Ueno ★★★★★

This made-to-order sushi restaurant is hidden away on the top floor of the mall, we only found it by following a hungry-looking salaryman!

After registering our group size (2) on the iPad out front, after a few minutes of waiting we were given a table at the counter. Here, we could watch the chefs selecting fish cuts, make ourselves hot green tea, and order dishes from the iPad.

Each "group" is separated by a plastic transparent barrier, so you can use their dishes for inspiration if needed whilst still having your own private space. Dishes are typically passed directly from the chefs in front of you, or sometimes via a waiter behind you, but there's no conveyer belt we could see.

The dishes themselves were good, perhaps not quite as good as elsewhere but hard to complain for the price. A few were unreasonably oversized making them a challenge to eat, be careful!

**[Original review (3 photos)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iTEe61Lr5cHkGSuV8)**

### Onitsuka Tiger Parco_ya Ueno ★★★★★

We visited 4-5 different Onitsuka Tiger stores during our trip, and this was consistently the quietest! Whilst others were chaotic and even had queues out front, this slightly less obvious location meant there were as many staff as customers.

Staff were helpful despite missing some items of stock, and the completely open store layout makes it a far better shopping experience than most footwear stores.

### Super Potato ★★★★✰

Super Potato felt like something from another world. After taking the lift up to the top floor, each floor had a different unique vibe. Some had a few guys hanging around playing arcade games, others were more like a small sweet shop, others were more like museums.

I can't comment on prices, but it was great seeing thousands of retro games and tech scattered everywhere, although the narrow corridors made it hard to navigate sometimes.

**[Original review (3 photos)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/W92ughhJFKJodVqJ9)**

### Edion Akiba ★★★★✰

This store has so much variety! Going up the escalators, you'll start with a massive variety of anime / gaming related figures, then go through watches, then wine, then microwaves, and suddenly you're surrounded by trading cards or a car racing track.

The top floor had trading card vending machines for various games, plus a few guys playing a game near the drinks vending machine, and it had a very calm and peaceful vibe. I can easily imagine spending a few hours here playing a card game with friends.

The car racing track wasn't open when I visited, but it seems to be frequently used, with all the related accessories sold nearby too.

**[Original review (1 photo)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mBmvo7Y6F5P3aqhy7)**

### Gachapon hall ★★★✰✰

A very dense gachapon hall. Machines are stacked high, and more than a couple of customers (plus members of staff emptying machines) makes it a challenge to make any progress looking at them all. Other locations have far more space, although perhaps less variety.

The machines are an OK price, with a change dispenser situated in the middle of the hall, employee desk in the middle, and figurine sales at the back.

**[Original review (1 photo)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Hqt1LQtjEMvvLM587)**

### GiGO Akihabara 2 ★★★✰✰

Quite a poorly laid out and expensive GiGO, mostly consisting of claw machines, many of which have bizarre items like household stools.

**[Original review (2 photos)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kcHXriwDhubPxaNk9)**

### Uniqlo Asakusa

A large, well laid out Uniqlo with multiple floors. There's plenty of appealing t-shirts here, plus of course the essential Airism polo / shirt / underwear for hot summers.

**[Original review (1 photo)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NW7qFC4GDrXryfTf6)**

### Tokyo Sumo Entertainment Show

This isn't a serious sumo show, nor is it trying to be. It's fun entertainment for tourists, and so long as you know what you're getting into, you'll have a great time!

After a short geisha show (fairly authentic as far as I can tell, it was just a much shorter version of a genuine performance seen in Kyoto), there's a typical hotpot meal provided, with free food refills (and paid drinks) available via a QR code mobile website. A presenter explains what's happening (in native English) throughout.

Those on the front seats will then have their tables taken away for the main event: Sumo! The 2 wrestlers are obviously playing characters, with all the pantomime "cheer for your guy, boo the other guy" style encouragement you'll recognise from other family-friendly entertainment. There's a bit of slapstick entertainment throughout, and the sumo wrestlers sell it well!

After showcasing some basic moves and pushes, the wrestlers have a "real" fight (with the audience throwing in the traditional salt). This looked convincing, but it's hard to tell as an outsider.

Next up is some audience participation! 6 or so candidates from ~10 volunteers were chosen, with ages ranging from 13 to late 40s. Whilst there's clearly been some behind-the-scenes coaching on what's going to happen, making these scripted fights, they're chaotic fun with lots of audience cheering throughout.

During our show, an Australian rules football player SEEMED to genuinely win his battle with pushing power! At the very least, the brief surprised shout from the losing wrestler was real. The wrestlers themselves deserve extra credit for their physical AND comedic performances.

Finally, you'll get a chance to take a photo with the wrestlers (and geisha), handled via efficient turn-based coordination, and be given a branded tote bag with branded wooden boxes, stickers, scarves, and your photos.

Overall this was a very fun couple of hours in the evening, and a great way to experience a heavily compacted (and simplified) slice of Japanese culture.
