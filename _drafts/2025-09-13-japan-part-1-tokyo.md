### Onyado Nono Asakusa ★★★★★

We had an excellent experience at Onyado Nono! The breakfast is the highlight feature, with an impressive variety of Japanese and Western options available, all freshly made.

Rooms are small but clean, with tatami mats throughout. Shoes are always stored in a locker area by the entrance, with comfortable loungewear & slippers provided in rooms. At breakfast, typically 50-90% of people will be wearing the beige loungewear, I recommend it!

Staff are helpful and very friendly, with standard laundry facilities available on the 2nd floor (plus tracking of them via the TV!). This made it a convenient place to do laundry on our trip.

### Age.3 ★★★★★

Age.3 is a strange innovation on sandwiches, with their sweet ones ending up something like cream-filled waffles. Worth a visit if nearby, although I'd recommend sharing 1 since they're pretty sweet!

### Sensō-ji Hozomon Gate ★★★★✰

Whilst the gate is overly full of tourists during the day, at night it becomes an excellent place to walk through. Unfortunately there is only a small amount of information available (entirely about the 2 statues), with the gate serving primarily as a photo opportunity and little else.

### Sensō-ji Five-Storied Pagoda ★★★★✰

As with most temples in the Senso-ji area, it is far better to visit at night for the visuals. Tourists are not allowed inside, and there is nothing to do here besides looking from the outside.

### Sensō-ji Temple ★★★★✰

The main part of the Senso-ji complex, good luck making it past all the tourists during the day! Worth visiting, you'll occasionally see locals making a contribution during open hours.

### Kaminari mon ★★★✰✰

Technically part of the Senso-ji temple, the close proximity to Nakamise shopping street makes this perhaps the most touristy part of the entire complex. You'll see tourists taking tripod photos / selfies at pretty much any hour, and during the day there is a dense crowd here. I'd highly recommend moving 100m up the road to Sensi-ji's Hozomon Gate for a bigger and better gate, with fewer people!

### Nakamise shopping street ★★★✰✰

This street features a variety of fairly touristy foods, drinks, and souvenirs. This street is completely full of people during the day, with lots of options for (overpriced) snacks from small shops where around half only accept cash. If you need to go through here I highly recommend using the 2 side streets.

At night the street gains a very peaceful vibe, with artwork on lots of the shop's shutters.

### Okimaro ★★★★★

This small cafe-style restaurant serving Okinawan was a pleasant surprise after struggling to find somewhere to eat a casual lunch near the Tokyo Skytree.

Around 10 people can be seated, and I'd highly recommend getting in before 12. We arrived at 11:50, and by 12:10 every seat was full of salarymen clearly having their regular lunches!

The portions are large, and whilst there is an excellent value lunch set menu available we went for a grilled chicken bowl and a limited-quantity pork belly based meal, along with a banana milk drink. An english menu is available out front, as well as inside.

### Gong Cha Asakusa ROX ★★★✰✰

A standard bubble / fruit tea shop, inside the ROX mall. It had quite a loud and chaotic vibe, clearly being a brief stop for families during shopping trips.

### Hoppy Street ★★★✰✰

Pretty much just a tourist trap, walking down here at night will see you shouted at by various touts, with far more affordable / genuine izakayas available elsewhere. If you're here at night, I'd recommend walking through senso-ji instead.

### Sumida Park ★★★★✰

A good spot for a brief rest if travelling from Asakusa towards the Skytree. Some shade, limited seating, and standard toilet facilities. The strip of shops alongside can be useful.

### Asakusa Gyukatsu ★★★★★

One of the best meals we had during a few weeks in Japan! There is almost always a queue outside, however late at night you can get in fairly quickly, with your order taken whilst queueing. The only options are 1, 1.5, or 2 beef cutlets, so picking should be easy!

Once inside, you are quickly served a tray of tonkatsu, and your cooking slab is heated. The beef cutlets are somehow ridiculously tasty and melt apart in your mouth, with the final few minutes of cooking yourself mostly just tweaking the flavour.

Helpfully, a guide on how to use each item / dip is provided in front of you in English and Japanese, since it can get a little confusing (there's a small mochi dessert included). We ordered 1 cutlet each, I'd probably recommend 1.5.
