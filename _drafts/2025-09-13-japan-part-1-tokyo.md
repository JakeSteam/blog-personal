### Onyado Nono Asakusa ★★★★★

We had an excellent experience at Onyado Nono! The breakfast is the highlight feature, with an impressive variety of Japanese and Western options available, all freshly made.

Rooms are small but clean, with tatami mats throughout. Shoes are always stored in a locker area by the entrance, with comfortable loungewear & slippers provided in rooms. At breakfast, typically 50-90% of people will be wearing the beige loungewear, I recommend it!

Staff are helpful and very friendly, with standard laundry facilities available on the 2nd floor (plus tracking of them via the TV!). This made it a convenient place to do laundry on our trip.

### Age.3 ★★★★★

Age.3 is a strange innovation on sandwiches, with their sweet ones ending up something like cream-filled waffles. Worth a visit if nearby, although I'd recommend sharing 1 since they're pretty sweet!

### Sensō-ji Hozomon Gate ★★★★✰

Whilst the gate is overly full of tourists during the day, at night it becomes an excellent place to walk through. Unfortunately there is only a small amount of information available (entirely about the 2 statues), with the gate serving primarily as a photo opportunity and little else.

### Sensō-ji Five-Storied Pagoda ★★★★✰

As with most temples in the Senso-ji area, it is far better to visit at night for the visuals. Tourists are not allowed inside, and there is nothing to do here besides looking from the outside.

### Sensō-ji Temple ★★★★✰

The main part of the Senso-ji complex, good luck making it past all the tourists during the day! Worth visiting, you'll occasionally see locals making a contribution during open hours.

### Kaminari mon ★★★✰✰

Technically part of the Senso-ji temple, the close proximity to Nakamise shopping street makes this perhaps the most touristy part of the entire complex. You'll see tourists taking tripod photos / selfies at pretty much any hour, and during the day there is a dense crowd here. I'd highly recommend moving 100m up the road to Sensi-ji's Hozomon Gate for a bigger and better gate, with fewer people!

### Nakamise shopping street ★★★✰✰

This street features a variety of fairly touristy foods, drinks, and souvenirs. This street is completely full of people during the day, with lots of options for (overpriced) snacks from small shops where around half only accept cash. If you need to go through here I highly recommend using the 2 side streets.

At night the street gains a very peaceful vibe, with artwork on lots of the shop's shutters.

### Okimaro ★★★★★

This small cafe-style restaurant serving Okinawan was a pleasant surprise after struggling to find somewhere to eat a casual lunch near the Tokyo Skytree.

Around 10 people can be seated, and I'd highly recommend getting in before 12. We arrived at 11:50, and by 12:10 every seat was full of salarymen clearly having their regular lunches!

The portions are large, and whilst there is an excellent value lunch set menu available we went for a grilled chicken bowl and a limited-quantity pork belly based meal, along with a banana milk drink. An english menu is available out front, as well as inside.

### Gong Cha Asakusa ROX ★★★✰✰

A standard bubble / fruit tea shop, inside the ROX mall. It had quite a loud and chaotic vibe, clearly being a brief stop for families during shopping trips.

### Hoppy Street ★★★✰✰

Pretty much just a tourist trap, walking down here at night will see you shouted at by various touts, with far more affordable / genuine izakayas available elsewhere. If you're here at night, I'd recommend walking through senso-ji instead.

### Sumida Park ★★★★✰

A good spot for a brief rest if travelling from Asakusa towards the Skytree. Some shade, limited seating, and standard toilet facilities. The strip of shops alongside can be useful.

### Asakusa Gyukatsu ★★★★★

One of the best meals we had during a few weeks in Japan! There is almost always a queue outside, however late at night you can get in fairly quickly, with your order taken whilst queueing. The only options are 1, 1.5, or 2 beef cutlets, so picking should be easy!

Once inside, you are quickly served a tray of tonkatsu, and your cooking slab is heated. The beef cutlets are somehow ridiculously tasty and melt apart in your mouth, with the final few minutes of cooking yourself mostly just tweaking the flavour.

Helpfully, a guide on how to use each item / dip is provided in front of you in English and Japanese, since it can get a little confusing (there's a small mochi dessert included). We ordered 1 cutlet each, I'd probably recommend 1.5.

## Day 2 (23rd August): Ginza

intro **23,018 steps (10.70 miles)**.

### Tsukiji Outer Market ★★★★✰

This chaotic market is unique, and has plenty to offer even if you have no interest in seafood. It's hard to know exactly which shops you're buying from, so you'll have to rely on instinct instead or reviews!

Whilst here we had matcha shaved ice, a custard dessert slab, and glazed fruit, all of which were great. The inner market is mostly fish, with the outer market consisting of more standard snacks and drinks. It's a BIG area, and finding a past shop can be tricky so just buy anything you like the look of!

It can get very crowded here, with some of the smaller alleyways being impossible to get down if a larger family or eating tour group is currently in there. The main roads and outside are easily navigated though, note many will only accept cash however.

### TEATRO eFfe TOKYO ★★★✰✰

A very sweet cream soda and matcha latte, plus fairly high prices and an enforced 1-drink-per-person policy (even when completely empty) makes the store hard to recommend if you're just after a drink. However, it does have good air con and is in a convenient location.

**[Original review](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fHRKG4k8DaPYFnJ86)**

### Hamarikyu Gardens ★★★★★

A good way to spend a few hours, with the small entry fee ensuring it's a quiet and peaceful contrast to the nearby Tsukiji market.

The Shonoji Isle bridges are great for photos, with the duck hunting sites providing some interesting information on how ducks were historically trapped here (it includes trained decoys!). The 300-year old pine is also impressively gnarled, whilst the Shogun's Landing Place is a fairly bland concrete area.

A special shoutout for the "rest area" is needed, since the shaded zone with sprayed water vapour (and a nearby drink seller) was absolutely essential when visiting on a summer day.

Overall it's a very aesthetic and well maintained garden area, providing contrast from the busy city nearby.

### Marutake ★★★★✰

This popular cash-only shop primarily sells warm tamago (sweet egg omelette), with a small strip costing 200 yen. Whilst nice, it's not particularly unique (there's another shop on the same street). There's no eating area, so you'll need to stand in the busy & chaotic street.

**[Original review (1 photo)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/T5Vf8JdR9pZTaD868)**

### Tomago-to-watashi ★★✰✰✰

Small restaurant within the station selling omurice (fluffy egg pancake with rice). The "soufflé" version was better, but both were fairly basic yet expensive meals. We struggled to get noticed when trying to make an order, with staff members seemingly initially avoiding us due to being foreigners, however there was an English menu available.

### Ginza Itoya ★★★★✰

A multi-level stationary store, even if you're not particularly into arts & crafts it's intriguing seeing all the options available. The ground floor is a bit too busy, and it can be hard to navigate.

**[Original review](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9Evmzcw2HrUFztoL8)**

### Ippudo Asakusa ★★★★★

Great ramen, fast service, order is via a touchscreen making it easy for foreigners. Ippudo was one of the few places open late at night, a lucky find!

Careful of the spicy ramen, they really mean spicy.
