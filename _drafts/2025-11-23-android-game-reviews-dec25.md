## #1: [Ironpost](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.genetix.ironpost)

I've played a few of [GX Studio's games](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=695774513565373570) before over the last few years, and like [Kairosoft's games](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=7710637777904825280), you _kinda_ know what you're in for, just with a different skin each time. This time, it's tower defence.

### Screenshots

All screenshots are from version 1.1.3:

### Review

As with [GX Studio's other games](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=695774513565373570) (e.g. Lone Tower, reviewed [2 years ago](/june-july-android-game-reviews/#3-lone-tower)), you complete a 1-10 minute playthrough of a simple game (in this case tower defence), with upgrades along the way, until you either fail or complete all stages. Either way you'll earn gems for permanent upgrades, with success having the benefit of unlocking harder, more rewarding difficulties.

The upgrades are varied but fairly straightforward, with simple stats like attack range, speed, and damage placed alongside knockback, lifesteal, luck (for critical hits), gold rewards on kill, etc. Killing enemies earns you coins to upgrade these within the run, earning gems lets you permanent unlock these. Additionally, there are occasional opportunities to pick perks such as extra damage, more XP per kill, etc.

This fairly simply gameplay loop is somewhat improved by the concept of "cards" (basically permanent upgradeable powerups). These can be as basic as crates giving more gold & XP, or situational such as extra damage when low HP.

The actual tower defence part of the game pretty much plays itself, with your interaction mostly limited to tapping the occasional crates that appear, and hoping you survive to the next upgrade opportunity. Oddly, the game also includes a fairly standard blackjack gambling system from the main menu.

Since initially downloading the game in August, a few new features (Auto crate open, auto perk pick) have been added alongside the existing quality of life features such as button colour customisation, increasing game speed, etc.

Overall, Ironpost isn't very complex, but it is a fairly satisfying way to spend 10-30 minutes occasionally, especially without any adverts or aggressive monetisation. Speaking from experience, it works great as a vertical split-screen game before bed if you're watching something else!

Looking at my statistics, I've played 80 runs, killed 23,000 enemies, and have unlocked Tier 6 difficulty.

_Note: I emailed the dev a bug report back in August and he fixed it a few days later, but other than that I have no connection / affiliation with the game._

### Monetisation

Adverts are available for a fairly minor boost, but are not forced, overpowered, or at all required.

### Tips

- There is a fairly active [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/gaDqxkTTGp) for all GX Studio games.
- I found Attack Speed to be the most powerful upgrade, with Attack Damage and Kill Gold Bonus being my next priorities.
- When picking perks mid-run, always choose more souls per kill if possible.
- I didn't find Interest Rate / Max Interest useful at all, since I typically spend all my gold.
- You _can_ manually aim your archer by tapping, but it doesn't seem to be very useful.
- For cards, you should aim to unlock all slots as soon as possible, and only upgrade the cards you find useful. For me, this was:
  - Critical Gold: Earn gold on critical hit.
  - Critical XP: Earn XP on critical hit.
  - Critical Heart: Heal on critical hit.
  - Plunder: Enemies sometimes drop gems on death.
  - Supply Drop: More gold & gems in crates.

## #1: [Word Run](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.genetix.wordrun)

It's another GX Studio game, like the first game in this article! This time, the gameplay loop is spelling words instead of tower defence.

### Review

Get a 4x4 grid of letters, spell the best word you can, earn enough points to complete the round before you run out of Plays. That's it!

Looking at my statistics, I've

### Monetisation

Unfortunately, there are forced video ads after every run, and no incentivised adverts / in-app purchases.

This is probably my least liked kind of monetisation, since it's not even possible to pay to remove the adverts. However, they are at least predictable. Additionally, with a run taking up to 10 minutes, they are infrequent.
