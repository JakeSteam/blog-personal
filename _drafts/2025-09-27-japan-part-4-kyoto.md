## Day 5 (3rd September): Osaka

A day trip to Osaka, this was mostly vintage clothing stores for my partner and aimless wandering by me! A total of **18,561 steps (8.45 miles)**.

### Umeda Sky Building ★★★★✰

This initially unassuming building has a quite good free area, with a shop and great views, but it's worth paying to go all the way up! No prebooking was needed when we came during a weekday morning.

The open-air top has good views of the surrounding area, although the ideal south view is blocked by other skyscrapers, unfortunately. There's a very small museum with the history of the building, containing an excellent time-lapse video of the unbelievable central area raising process.

There's a fairly good food & drink shop inside, worth a rest here if you can get a good window seat.

### Glico Sign Dotonbori ★★★✰✰

Iconic, but ultimately just a large sign visible from a crowded bridge. More of a checklist item than actually good!

### Shinsekai Market ★★★✰✰

A slightly run down shopping avenue with various small shops selling food and souvenirs. Most were closed or half-open on a normal weekday afternoon, so I suspect this only exists to catch visitors at the weekend!

### Shinsekai ★★★★✰

A busy few streets centred on the distinctive Tsutenkaku tower, with lots of over the top decorations! There are plenty of food options here, along with all the typical Don Quijote and convenience stores. Worth a visit for a meal, but perhaps not more than a couple of hours.

### Naniwa Kushikatsu Shichifuku ★★★★★

We accidentally came here looking for somewhere else, but we're glad we did! Excellent kushikatsu is ordered via a multilingual ipad, along with drinks and other snacks, and the chef was helpful in describing what the variety of fried food actually was.

It was fairly quiet when we visited during a weekday afternoon, with only a few locals chatting at another table, and food and drinks were prepared quickly.

### Shinsaibashi-Suji ★★★✰✰

A fairly typical, albeit larger than usual, shopping street. Lots of brands and chain stores instead of the usual unique stores, and many vintage clothing stores. As busy as you'd expect for central Osaka.
