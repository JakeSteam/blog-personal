## Day 5 (3rd September): Osaka

A day trip to Osaka, this was mostly vintage clothing stores for my partner and aimless wandering by me! A total of **18,561 steps (8.45 miles)**.

### Umeda Sky Building ★★★★✰

This initially unassuming building has a quite good free area, with a shop and great views, but it's worth paying to go all the way up! No prebooking was needed when we came during a weekday morning.

The open-air top has good views of the surrounding area, although the ideal south view is blocked by other skyscrapers, unfortunately. There's a very small museum with the history of the building, containing an excellent time-lapse video of the unbelievable central area raising process.

There's a fairly good food & drink shop inside, worth a rest here if you can get a good window seat.

### Glico Sign Dotonbori ★★★✰✰

Iconic, but ultimately just a large sign visible from a crowded bridge. More of a checklist item than actually good!

### Shinsekai Market ★★★✰✰

A slightly run down shopping avenue with various small shops selling food and souvenirs. Most were closed or half-open on a normal weekday afternoon, so I suspect this only exists to catch visitors at the weekend!

### Shinsekai ★★★★✰

A busy few streets centred on the distinctive Tsutenkaku tower, with lots of over the top decorations! There are plenty of food options here, along with all the typical Don Quijote and convenience stores. Worth a visit for a meal, but perhaps not more than a couple of hours.

### Naniwa Kushikatsu Shichifuku ★★★★★

We accidentally came here looking for somewhere else, but we're glad we did! Excellent kushikatsu is ordered via a multilingual ipad, along with drinks and other snacks, and the chef was helpful in describing what the variety of fried food actually was.

It was fairly quiet when we visited during a weekday afternoon, with only a few locals chatting at another table, and food and drinks were prepared quickly.

### Shinsaibashi-Suji ★★★✰✰

A fairly typical, albeit larger than usual, shopping street. Lots of brands and chain stores instead of the usual unique stores, and many vintage clothing stores. As busy as you'd expect for central Osaka.

## Day 6 (4th September): Misc

A rare peaceful and unplanned day, with only a few spontaneous events plus plenty of shopping! A relatively small **13,334 steps (5.88 miles)**.

### Gion Kagai Art Museum ★★★★★

We came here after a recommendation during a Gion walking tour, and it definitely deserves to be more popular! Upon entry, you'll need to remove your shoes and your ticket will be checked. Next, you'll spend some time in the museum before your performance, followed by a tea room and pretty garden. Overall you should expect to spend around 60-90 minutes here.

The museum consists of 5-6 rooms with historical information on Geiko (Geisha) and Japanese culture, with Japanese text but a QR code to read it in English on your phone. These were very interesting, and we could have spent far longer here before being informed our booked performance time was about to start. I'd recommend coming 30 minutes before your performance time to allow enough time for the museum beforehand.

Surprisingly, we had a genuine geiko (geisha) for our performance, who was introduced by museum staff and did not say a word / display any expression throughout her 15 minute performance, clearly a professional. Whilst I can't pretend to fully understand the dance's culture at all, she was obviously confident in her abilities, and it was powerful. No photos or talking are allowed during the performance, with a page of information provided beforehand.

After the performance, you can pay extra to get a photo with her, or progress to the shop / tea room. We had a green tea here, which was surprisingly slow but came with small snacks so balanced out! The shop has magnets / photos of all the performers and other similar merchandise, with today's highlighted so you can easily identify them.

### the Art Cafe ★★★★★

A small tea room / cafe, accessible within the Gion Kagai Art Museum after watching a performance and next to the museum shop.

We ordered a green tea here, and it took a surprisingly long time to prepare, but that's probably due to being made from scratch just for us (there were no other visitors), and came with small mochi snacks.

There's an excellent view over a well maintained garden whilst resting here.

### Nandattei ★★★★★

Unbelievably excellent tomato curry ramen. Hot temperature, hot spiciness, lively yet quiet atmosphere as everyone is busy eating apart from the chefs!

The entrance can be a little hard to find, hidden down a side street opposite a burger shop, inside a sliding door. The inside is reminiscent of an izakaya, with the chefs working away in front of you inside the L-shaped eating counter. There can be a short wait, but people get through their meals pretty fast so it's acceptable.

Pictured is the Number 21 (Tomato Curry Tsukemen), a very affordable (¥1150) and filling dinner.

## Day 7 (5th September): Hiroshima

A day trip to Hiroshima, with the long travel time (2.5-3 hours each way, made worse by [typhoon flooding](https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/16008107)) resulting in only **10,039 steps (4.31 miles)**.
